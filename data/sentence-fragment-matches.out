Tool use, whether using a stone, stick, rake, or pliers, provides an extension of the body (Van Lawick-Goodall, 1970) and involves, among other things, the transfer of a proximal movement goal for the hand into a more distal goal for the tool (Johnson and Grafton, 2003; Arbib et al., 2009).

A compelling demonstration that this transfer might actually occur at the cortical level comes from neural recordings of grasping neurons in the ventral premotor cortex (PMv) and motor cortex (M1) of macaque monkeys trained to use pliers (Umilta et al., 2008).

In both these areas, many neurons that encoded the specifics of hand grasping subsequently encoded tool grasping, even when use of the specific tool (reverse pliers that close as the hand grip opens) required hand kinematics opposite to those required when grasping with the hand alone.

fMRI (3 Tesla) was used to measure the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal in the brains of 13 right-handed subjects (7 females; mean age: 25.7 years) during a slow event-related design with a delay interval.

Subjects used either the right hand or a tool (controlled by the right hand) to execute a precision reach-to-grasp (Grasp) or reach-to-touch (Reach) movement towards a single centrally located real three-dimensional (3D) target object made of Lego blocks (Figure 1B).

Behavioral, neuropsychological and neurophysiological evidence demonstrates that a central and governing feature of movement planning, and indeed of higher-level cognition in general, is the linking together of overarching action goals with the precise underlying kinematics required by the body to achieve those goals (Haaland et al., 2000; Andersen and Buneo, 2002; Fogassi et al., 2005; Grafton and Hamilton, 2007; Umilta et al., 2008).

Here we manipulated the type of object-directed hand action that was planned (grasping vs reaching) as well as the effector (hand vs tool) used to implement that action.

At the effector-specific level, we found that SPOC and EBA discriminated upcoming hand movements only whereas SMG and pMTG discriminated upcoming tool movements only.

At the effector-independent level, in posterior parietal (pIPS and midIPS) and premotor (PMd and PMv) cortex areas, we found that the pre-movement patterns predictive of grasp vs reach actions for the hand also predicted grasp vs reach actions with the tool.

Notably, because the tool-effector required very different hand kinematics than when the hand was used alone, this suggests that these brain areas encoded the action performed rather than the specific muscle movements needed to achieve it.
