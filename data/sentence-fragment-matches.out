Tool use, whether using a stone, stick, rake, or pliers, provides an extension of the body (Van Lawick-Goodall, 1970) and involves, among other things, the transfer of a proximal movement goal for the hand into a more distal goal for the tool (Johnson and Grafton, 2003; Arbib et al., 2009).

A compelling demonstration that this transfer might actually occur at the cortical level comes from neural recordings of grasping neurons in the ventral premotor cortex (PMv) and motor cortex (M1) of macaque monkeys trained to use pliers (Umilta et al., 2008).

In both these areas, many neurons that encoded the specifics of hand grasping subsequently encoded tool grasping, even when use of the specific tool (reverse pliers that close as the hand grip opens) required hand kinematics opposite to those required when grasping with the hand alone.

These findings suggest that tool use is supported by an effector-independent level of representation, in which the overall goal of the motor act is coded separately from the precise hand kinematics required to operate the tool.

In further support of this notion, findings from human neuropsychology (Berti and Frassinetti, 2000; Maravita and Iriki, 2004), human behavior (Gentilucci et al., 2004; Cardinali et al., 2009, 2012), and macaque monkey neurophysiology (Iriki et al., 1996) suggest that following training, a tool may actually become incorporated into the body schema of the actor and coded as an extension of the hand/limb.

While provocative, how well does this single mechanism explain the neural substrates of tool use in humans, particularly within established networks that have been identified for tools (Lewis, 2006), hand actions (Culham et al., 2006), and body perception (Peelen and Downing, 2007)?

Although considerable research has been done on the brain networks specialized for visual processing of tools and bodies and the visual-motor processing of hand actions, these topics have largely been studied in isolation.

Increasing evidence from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) suggests that human frontoparietal and occipitotemporal cortex contain specialized regions that selectively represent tools and bodies (Downing et al., 2001; Lewis, 2006; Frey, 2007; Peelen and Downing, 2007; Peeters et al., 2009; Valyear and Culham, 2010; Bracci et al., 2012).

For instance, when individuals view, imagine, or pantomime tool use actions, the supramarginal gyrus (SMG), posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG), and dorsal premotor cortex (PMd)â€”areas that have shown some of the greatest evolutionary expansion in humans (Van Essen and Dierker, 2007)â€”are often co-activated (Lewis, 2006; Frey, 2007).

fMRI studies further suggest that human occipitotemporal cortex also contains body-selective regions for perception, such as the extrastriate body area (EBA), which preferentially respond to viewing of the body and its parts (Astafiev et al., 2004; David et al., 2007; Peelen and Downing, 2007).

The frontoparietal regions activated by tools are spatially close to (and perhaps overlapping with) brain areas implicated in hand actions, particularly the grip component of reach-to-grasp actions.

Specifically, SMG lies very near the grasp-selective anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS, Chao and Martin, 2000; Valyear et al., 2007) and PMd shows grasp-selective as well as tool-selective responses (Grezes and Decety, 2002; Gallivan et al., 2011).

Map(start -> 127, end -> 127, match -> ,)
Map(start -> 242, end -> 242, match -> ,)

In addition, real hand actions activate other frontoparietal regions including the superior parieto-occipital cortex (SPOC) region, PMd, and additional areas along the IPS (Culham et al., 2006; Filimon, 2010), but the specific role of these areas in tool use remains unexplored.

Moreover, almost all of the human neuroimaging studies of tools to date have used proxies for real tool use (reviewed in Lewis, 2006), including visual stimuli such as images or movies (e.g., Beauchamp et al., 2002), semantic tasks (e.g., Martin et al., 1995), or simulated tool actions like pantomiming, imitating or imagining tool use (e.g., Johnson-Frey et al., 2005; Rumiati et al., 2004) or making perceptual judgments about how one would use a tool (e.g., Jacobs et al., 2010).

It remains unclear whether the highly specialized brain areas within these tool-, body-, and action-related networks in humans also play important roles in planning real movements with a tool or with the body (hand) alone.

The purpose of the current study was to examine exactly how and where in the human brain tool-specific, hand-specific, and effector-independent (shared hand and tool) representations are coded.

To this aim we used fMRI to examine neural activity while human subjects performed a delayed-movement task that required grasp or reach actions towards a single target object.
Map(start -> 3, end -> 6, match -> this)

Critically, subjects performed these two different movements using either their hand or reverse tongs, which required opposite operating kinematics compared to when the hand was used alone.
Map(start -> 165, end -> 167, match -> the)
Map(start -> 174, end -> 176, match -> was)

This manipulation allowed us to maintain a common set of actions throughout the experiment (grasping vs reaching) while at the same time varying the movement kinematics required to achieve those actions (i.e., depending on whether the hand vs tool effector was used).

Using multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to decode preparatory (pre-movement) signals, we then probed exactly where in frontoparietal cortex and in tool- and body-selective areas in occipitotemporal cortex movement plans (grasping vs reaching) for the hand and tool were distinct (effector-specific) vs where signals related to upcoming actions of the hand could be used to predict the same actions performed with the tool (effector-independent).

Map(start -> 415, end -> 417, match -> the)

Consistent with an effector-specific coding of hand- and tool-related movements we found that preparatory signals in SPOC and EBA differentiated upcoming movements of the hand only (i.e., hand-specific) whereas in SMG and pMTG they discriminated upcoming movements of the tool only (i.e., tool-specific).

Map(start -> 277, end -> 280, match -> only)
Map(start -> 287, end -> 287, match -> ,)

In addition, in anterior parietal regions (e.g., aIPS) and motor cortex we found that pre-movement activity patterns discriminated planned actions of â€˜bothâ€™ the hand and tool but, importantly, could not be used to predict upcoming actions of the other effector.

Map(start -> 242, end -> 244, match -> the)

Instead, we found that this effector-independent type of coding was constrained to the preparatory signals of a subset of frontoparietal areas (posterior IPS and premotor cortex), suggesting that in these regions neural representations are more tightly linked to the goal of the action (grasping vs reaching) rather than the specific hand movements required to implement those goals.

fMRI (3 Tesla) was used to measure the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal in the brains of 13 right-handed subjects (7 females; mean age: 25.7 years) during a slow event-related design with a delay interval.

Subjects used either the right hand or a tool (controlled by the right hand) to execute a precision reach-to-grasp (Grasp) or reach-to-touch (Reach) movement towards a single centrally located real three-dimensional (3D) target object made of Lego blocks (Figure 1B).

MVPA was performed using single fMRI trials in two ways: 1) based on the % signal change (SC) BOLD activation evoked for each single time point in the trial (time-resolved decoding), allowing us to pinpoint when predictive movement information was available and 2) based on a windowed average of the % SC BOLD activation in the 4 s (2 imaging volumes) prior to movement initiation (denoted by the gray shaded bar).DOI:http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00425.003

We implemented MVPA in specific frontoparietal and occipitotemporal cortex regions-of-interest (ROIs) for each time-point within a trial and examined, during movement planning (Plan Phase): 1) whether we could predict upcoming grasps (G) vs reaches (R) with either the hand (i.e., Hand-G vs Hand-R) or tool (i.e., Tool-G vs Tool-R) or both and 2) where in the network of areas preparatory patterns of activity for the hand could be used to predict preparatory patterns of activity for the tool and vice versa (e.g., where Hand-G predicts Tool-G activity, and vice versa).

With respect to this second aim, it is important to note that based on differences between hand and tool experimental runs, a brain area showing effector-independent preparatory activity patterns cannot be attributable to low-level similarities in motor kinematics (i.e., because the hand and tool required opposite operating mechanics) or sensory input across trial types (i.e., because the objectâ€™s visual position with respect to fixation changed between hand and tool runs).

We first localized a common set of action-related ROIs within each individual subject for subsequent MVPA.

These ROIs were defined by performing a whole-brain voxel-wise search contrasting the activity evoked during movement generation (i.e., movement planning [Plan phase] and execution [Execute phase]) vs the activity evoked during simple visual object presentation (Preview phase; when subjects had vision of the target object yet were unaware of which action [Grasp vs Reach] to perform).

Within this network, we focused MVPA on 10 commonly described neuroanatomical ROIs in the left hemisphere (contralateral to the arm used), each previously implicated in either hand-related and/or tool-related processing.

We localized superior parieto-occipital cortex (SPOC), posterior intraparietal sulcus (pIPS), middle IPS (midIPS), motor cortex, and dorsal premotor (PMd) cortexâ€”a group of well-known parietal and frontal areas generally implicated in hand-related movement planning processes in human and/or macaque cortex (Culham et al., 2006; Andersen and Cui, 2009; Cisek and Kalaska, 2010).

In addition, we defined the anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS), a region just posterior to aIPS (post.

aIPS), supramarginal gyrus (SMG), and ventral premotor (PMv) cortexâ€”a group of parietal and frontal areas generally implicated in hand preshaping and tool-related processes (Rizzolatti and Luppino, 2001; Culham et al., 2006; Lewis, 2006; Umilta et al., 2008).

One additional area, left somatosensory (SS-cortex), was selected as a sensory control region, not expected to accurately decode movements until stimulation of the handâ€™s mechanoreceptors at movement onset (i.e., at the Execute phase).10.7554/eLife.00425.004Figure 2.Frontoparietal brain areas selected for movement plan decoding.Cortical areas that exhibited larger responses during movement preparation and/or execution than the preceding visual phase [(Plan + Execute) > 2*(Preview)] are shown as orange/yellow activation.

The purpose of this second scan session was to localize well-documented visual-perceptual ROIs involved in body- and tool-selective processing and then examine, using the motor experiment data from these same subjects, whether hand and tool movement plans could be decoded from these separately identified object-selective areas.

One area of interest, EBA, has been widely implicated in coding perceptual functions related to the body, including the identification of other individuals, the processing of othersâ€™ emotional states and movements, as well as perception of the self and representations of the body schema (Downing and Peelen, 2011).

Likewise, pMTG has been implicated in coding numerous perceptual functions related to tools, including tool motion, identification, naming, auditory processing, and the retrieval of semantic information concerning their use (e.g., Martin et al., 1996; Beauchamp and Martin, 2007; Lewis et al., 2005).

Map(start -> 292, end -> 292, match -> ,)

Interestingly, both ROIs are also activated by self-generated movements (unseen hand actions in the case of EBA and pantomimed tool actions in the case of pMTG; Lewis, 2006; Frey, 2007; Downing and Peelen, 2011).

The aim here was to clarify the nature and specificity of these sensory-motor responses in the context of planning object-directed hand and tool movements.

To localize these visual-perceptual ROIs we used a standard block-design localizer task in which participants were required to view static color photos of familiar tools, headless bodies, non-tool objects, and scrambled up versions of these same stimuli (Figure 5A for timing and protocol; see also Valyear and Culham, 2010).

Map(start -> 232, end -> 233, match -> of)
Map(start -> 265, end -> 267, match -> for)

To identify the brain areas selectively involved in tool-related visual processing, in each subject we searched for regions showing heightened activation for tools compared to headless bodies, non-tool objects, and scrambled stimuli (conjunction contrast: [(Tools > Bodies) AND (Tools > Objects) AND (Tools > Scrambled)], t = 3, p<0.005, corrected).

Across subjects, this contrast revealed consistent activity in two brain regions: 1) pMTG and 2) an area located anteriorly along the IPS (tool-aIPS, t-aIPS).
Map(start -> 17, end -> 20, match -> this)
Map(start -> 130, end -> 132, match -> the)

The anatomical locations of these tool-specific activations were highly consistent with previous investigations (Figures 5 and 6; Mahon et al., 2007; Valyear and Culham, 2010).
Map(start -> 0, end -> 2, match -> the)
Map(start -> 25, end -> 26, match -> of)

We next searched for body-selective regions by contrasting activity for bodies compared to tools, non-tool objects, and scrambled stimuli (conjunction contrast: [(Bodies > Tools) AND (Bodies > Objects) AND (Bodies > Scrambled)], t = 3, p<0.005, corrected).

Map(start -> 243, end -> 243, match -> ,)

Across subjects, this contrast revealed consistent activity in EBA, which responds selectively to human bodies and body parts when compared with objects and other control stimuli (Downing et al., 2001; Figure 6).
Map(start -> 17, end -> 20, match -> this)
Map(start -> 194, end -> 194, match -> ,)

Notably, in each subject we found a highly consistent spatial relationship between EBA and pMTG: pMTG was characteristically positioned lateral, ventral, and anterior to EBA (consistent with Valyear and Culham, 2010).

Behavioral, neuropsychological and neurophysiological evidence demonstrates that a central and governing feature of movement planning, and indeed of higher-level cognition in general, is the linking together of overarching action goals with the precise underlying kinematics required by the body to achieve those goals (Haaland et al., 2000; Andersen and Buneo, 2002; Fogassi et al., 2005; Grafton and Hamilton, 2007; Umilta et al., 2008).

Exactly how the human brain supports this cognitive capacity, particularly in the everyday example of tool-use, remains poorly understood.

Here we manipulated the type of object-directed hand action that was planned (grasping vs reaching) as well as the effector (hand vs tool) used to implement that action.

At the effector-specific level, we found that SPOC and EBA discriminated upcoming hand movements only whereas SMG and pMTG discriminated upcoming tool movements only.

Map(start -> 97, end -> 100, match -> only)
Map(start -> 161, end -> 164, match -> only)

aIPS, aIPS, t-aIPS) and motor cortex areas discriminated planned actions for both the hand and tool, but did not cross-decode between the two effectors.

Map(start -> 134, end -> 136, match -> the)

At the effector-independent level, in posterior parietal (pIPS and midIPS) and premotor (PMd and PMv) cortex areas, we found that the pre-movement patterns predictive of grasp vs reach actions for the hand also predicted grasp vs reach actions with the tool.

Notably, because the tool-effector required very different hand kinematics than when the hand was used alone, this suggests that these brain areas encoded the action performed rather than the specific muscle movements needed to achieve it.

Consistent with the transfer of goals for the hand to those of the tool, this finding resonates with embodied theories of tool use whereby through use, tools become incorporated as part of the body schema.

Notably, however, in the majority of regions tested we find that neural representations remain linked to either the hand or tool.
