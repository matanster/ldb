sentence 'These tasks differ in the type of processing required (Schilling et al., 1998): naming emphasizes producing the sounds of the word (although this can be greatly facilitated by lexical and semantic access), lexical decision emphasizes how familiar the word is (Gernsbacher, 1984; which is highly related to word frequency), and reading emphasizes accessing the meaning of the word (but obviously involves processing the word’s sounds and familiarity, as well).

sentence 'Taken together, data on frequency effects across tasks suggest that when word identiﬁcation does not occur (either because it is not necessary, as in word search, or shuts off, as in mindless reading) subjects are insensitive or minimally sensitive to word frequency, whereas when word identiﬁcation is required or emphasized (as in reading and lexical decision) frequency inﬂuences how long it takes to do so, although the precise way in which it does so in these cases also depends on the particular requirements of the task.

sentence 'This framework is agnostic as to the speciﬁc model of eye movement control in reading (e.g., Bicknell & Levy, 2010; Engbert, Nuthmann, Richter, & Kliegl, 2005; Reichle, Pollatsek, Fisher, & Rayner, 1998; Reichle, Rayner, & Pollatsek, 2003; Schad & Engbert, 2012) assumed, although it should be noted that any complete model of reading must ultimately be able to account for task differences in reading behavior.

sentence 'Word-form recognition can involve both decisions about whether or not the letter string is a word and, furthermore, what exact word it is. For example, wordhood assessment, which we deﬁne as recognizing whether the letter string has a legal (known) orthographic entry (similar to the ‘‘orthographic checking’’ process hypothesized by Kaakinen & Hyönä, 2010) is most obviously relevant for proofreading, but is also relevant even for normal reading since the reader must be able to deal with novel words.

sentence 'Nevertheless, if accessing content and performing sentence-level processing are not costly, it is possible that these processes would not be de-emphasized, since sentence-level context makes reading more efﬁcient overall (Bicknell & Levy, 2012; Ehrlich & Rayner, 1981; Morton, 1964; Rayner & Well, 1996). '

sentence 'However, it is unclear how sentence-level integration would be affected by proofreading for wrong words in comparison with normal reading (and so all three possibilities are represented): it might be enhanced by the need to perform effective word-context validation, it might be reduced since the depth of interpretation required for successful normal reading may not be necessary or worthwhile for adequate proofreading for wrong words, or it could remain unchanged.

sentence 'Wordhood assessment and content access need to occur when a word is ﬁrst encountered in order for understanding Table 1 Framework of some processes involved in normal reading and our hypotheses about how they change when proofreading for the two types of errors involved in Experiment 1 (nonwords) and Experiment 2 (wrong words).

sentence 'In sentence-level processing, however, predictability, which reﬂects degree of contextual ﬁt, is likely to be far more important than frequency: words with higher predictability are likely to be easier to integrate syntactically (Hale, 2001; Levy, 2008) and semantically (Kutas & Hillyard, 1984), and easier to validate as being a valid word, given the context and the visual input (Levy, Bicknell, Slattery, & Rayner, 2009).

sentence 'Less detectable are wrong word errors (Daneman & Stainton, 1993; Levy et al., 1986), which moreover show differences in the contribution of phonological similarity to the intended word: homophone substitutions (e.g., mail for male) are less detectable than spelling control substitutions (e.g., mile; Banks, Oka, & Shugarman, 1981; Jared et al., 1999), potentially implicating that phonological status may mediate content access.
