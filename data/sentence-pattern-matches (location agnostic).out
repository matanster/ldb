sentence 'Many PCM proteins, however, can be recruited to mitotic centrosomes in the absence of Cnn, albeit at reduced levels (Lucas and Raff, 2007), suggesting that at least one other protein must be able to form a scaffold around centrioles that can recruit other PCM components.'

sentence 'Thus, although the centrosomal binding sites for DSpd-2 and Cnn appear to be concentrated around the mother centriole, they do not precisely overlap and they recruit DSpd-2 and Cnn at different rates, strongly suggesting that DSpd-2 and Cnn are not incorporated into the PCM together as part of the same complex.'
