Although centrioles usually organize only small amounts of PCM in interphase cells, the PCM expands dramatically as cells prepare to enter mitosisâ€”a process termed centrosome maturation (Khodjakov and Rieder, 1999).
Many PCM proteins, however, can be recruited to mitotic centrosomes in the absence of Cnn, albeit at reduced levels (Lucas and Raff, 2007), suggesting that at least one other protein must be able to form a scaffold around centrioles that can recruit other PCM components.
Although DSpd-2 and Cnn have a major role in centrosome maturation, we stress that other PCM components are likely to make important contributions.
