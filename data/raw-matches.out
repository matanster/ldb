Two hallmark effects derive from the frequency of a word to be processed (high frequency words are processed more quickly than low frequency words) and the predictability of a word in its sentence context (more predictable words are processed more quickly than less predictable words; see Kutas & Federmeier, 2011; Rayner, 1998, 2009 0010-0277/$ - see front matter Ó 2013 The Authors.

In the present study, we investigated this cognitive ﬂexibility in reading for comprehension and proofreading. 
Map(start -> 75, end -> 77, match -> for)

While still poorly understood, proofreading is a useful task for elucidating how cognitive processing changes along with task demands because of its similarity to reading for comprehension in terms of stimuli and response measure. 
Map(start -> 61, end -> 63, match -> for)
Map(start -> 171, end -> 173, match -> for)

The only differences in experimental design between these two tasks are the instructions and the inclusion of sentences that contain an error. 
Map(start -> 4, end -> 7, match -> only)

Thus, we can study how processing of sentences without errors changes when people are asked to process them in different ways: checking for errors or reading for understanding.

Frequency effects Word frequency is one of the strongest linguistic aspects of a word that affects how easily it is processed, across many tasks (lexical decision, Stanners, Jastrzembski, & Westbrook, 1975; word naming, Berry, 1971; Forster & Chambers, 1973; reading a sentence, as indexed by eye ﬁxation times, Inhoff & Rayner, 1986; Rayner & Duffy, 1986; see Rayner, 1998, 2009 for reviews; and event related potentials, King & Kutas, 1998; Polich & Donchin, 1988; see Kutas & Federmeier, 2011 for a review). 
Map(start -> 373, end -> 374, match -> , )
Map(start -> 380, end -> 382, match -> for)
Map(start -> 496, end -> 498, match -> for)

In general, crossexperiment comparisons cannot convincingly test whether frequency effects change size across tasks because they use different stimuli (the magnitude of the effect on the response variable depends on the magnitude of the frequency manipulation) and different subjects (more skilled readers show smaller frequency effects than average readers; Ashby, Rayner, & Clifton, 2005). 
Map(start -> 60, end -> 71, match -> test whether)
Map(start -> 337, end -> 340, match -> than)

The most direct indication that frequency effects change across tasks comes from studies by Schilling, Rayner, and Chumbley (1998; for a more recent similar study, see Kuperman, Drieghe, Keuleers, & Brysbaert, 2013) and Rayner and Raney (1996; see also Rayner & Fischer, 1996, as well as Murray & Forster, 2008). 
Map(start -> 131, end -> 133, match -> for)

These tasks differ in the type of processing required (Schilling et al., 1998): naming emphasizes producing the sounds of the word (although this can be greatly facilitated by lexical and semantic access), lexical decision emphasizes how familiar the word is (Gernsbacher, 1984; which is highly related to word frequency), and reading emphasizes accessing the meaning of the word (but obviously involves processing the word’s sounds and familiarity, as well). 
Map(start -> 71, end -> 72, match -> , )
Map(start -> 132, end -> 139, match -> although)

Rayner and Raney (1996); see also Rayner & Fischer, 1996) found that the frequency effect (which was 53 ms when subjects read for comprehension) went away (i.e., was only 1 ms) when subjects searched for a particular word in a passage (and responded when they had found it). 
Map(start -> 97, end -> 99, match -> was)
Map(start -> 126, end -> 128, match -> for)
Map(start -> 162, end -> 164, match -> was)
Map(start -> 166, end -> 169, match -> only)
Map(start -> 200, end -> 202, match -> for)

Rayner and Raney suggested that reading for comprehension requires accessing meaning (dependent on lexical access) and searching for a word in a text can be performed by more surface-level matching and may not be sensitive to frequency. 
Map(start -> 40, end -> 42, match -> for)
Map(start -> 129, end -> 131, match -> for)

Taken together, data on frequency effects across tasks suggest that when word identiﬁcation does not occur (either because it is not necessary, as in word search, or shuts off, as in mindless reading) subjects are insensitive or minimally sensitive to word frequency, whereas when word identiﬁcation is required or emphasized (as in reading and lexical decision) frequency inﬂuences how long it takes to do so, although the precise way in which it does so in these cases also depends on the particular requirements of the task. 
Map(start -> 411, end -> 418, match -> although)

In fact, the predictability of a word (i.e., how expected the word is, given the prior context) has an effect on reading times and ﬁxation probabilities (Balota, Pollatsek, & Rayner, 1985; Drieghe, Rayner, & Pollatsek, 2005; Ehrlich & Rayner, 1981; Kliegl, Grabner, Rolfs, & Engbert, 2004; Rayner, Slattery, Drieghe, & Liversedge, 2011; Rayner & Well, 1996; Zola, 1984; see Rayner, 1998, 2009 for reviews) as well as ERPs (Kutas & Hillyard, 1984; see Kutas & Federmeier, 2011 for a review). 
Map(start -> 96, end -> 98, match -> has)
Map(start -> 386, end -> 387, match -> , )
Map(start -> 393, end -> 395, match -> for)
Map(start -> 476, end -> 478, match -> for)

Tests for predictability effects in isolated word processing tasks are rare. 
Map(start -> 6, end -> 8, match -> for)

However, some studies have recorded response times to target words presented after a sentence context (in word naming: Stanovich & West, 1979, 1981; West & Stanovich, 1982; and lexical decision: Schuberth & Eimas, 1977) or when the target word is preceded by a single prime word (in naming: de Groot, 1985; Meyer & Schvaneveldt, 1971; and lexical decision: Schuberth & Eimas, 1977). 
Map(start -> 141, end -> 142, match -> , )

Here, cross task comparisons reveal that the predictability effect for primed lexical decision (65 ms) is larger than for primed naming (38 ms; de Groot, 1 Schilling et al. (1998) also analyzed ﬁrst ﬁxation duration and single ﬁxation duration. 
Map(start -> 67, end -> 69, match -> for)
Map(start -> 113, end -> 116, match -> than)
Map(start -> 118, end -> 120, match -> for)

Thus, comparisons between tasks, such as Schilling et al. (1998; de Groot, 1985; Kuperman et al., 2013; West & Stanovich, 1982) are suggestive of, but not conclusive about, how different tasks affect word processing, particularly with respect to how word properties are emphasized. 
Map(start -> 96, end -> 97, match -> , )

Therefore, we turn to a pair of tasks that can utilize the same stimuli, subjects, and response measures: reading for comprehension and proofreading. 
Map(start -> 114, end -> 116, match -> for)

Kaakinen and Hyönä (2 010) did just this: they compared frequency effects while subjects were reading sentences for comprehension vs. proofreading for spelling errors. 
Map(start -> 112, end -> 114, match -> for)
Map(start -> 147, end -> 149, match -> for)

First, however, we discuss possible task differences introduced by proofreading, introduce a framework within which to understand and predict these task differences, and discuss previous studies investigating proofreading. 
Map(start -> 7, end -> 13, match -> however)
Map(start -> 7, end -> 13, match -> however)
Map(start -> 119, end -> 128, match -> understand)
Map(start -> 119, end -> 128, match -> understand)

Most studies (including our present research) focus on misspellings, for which the error is localized to a speciﬁc word. 
Map(start -> 69, end -> 71, match -> for)

Perhaps the most easily detectable of these errors are those that produce nonwords (nonword errors; e.g., trcak for track). 
Map(start -> 112, end -> 114, match -> for)

Detection of these errors requires only the assessment of word status (i.e., whether the letter string is a known word; Daneman & Stainton, 1993; Levy, Newell, Snyder, & Timmins, 1986), and they can sometimes be identiﬁed from the surface features of the word alone (i.e., determining if the letter string follows orthographic rules of the language or can yield pronounceable output). 
Map(start -> 35, end -> 38, match -> only)
Map(start -> 108, end -> 112, match -> known)

Proofreading for these nonword (surface level) errors may be easiest because the proofreader need only check orthographic legality and/or word status and then stop (i.e., not try to integrate an error into the sentence). 
Map(start -> 13, end -> 15, match -> for)
Map(start -> 98, end -> 101, match -> only)

Consequently, to detect these types of errors, proofreaders may need to perform deeper processing than for nonword errors: they must know not only that a letter string is a word, but also what word it is, what its syntactic and semantic properties are, and whether some other word would have been appropriate instead, in order to decide whether it is an incorrect word. 
Map(start -> 98, end -> 101, match -> than)
Map(start -> 103, end -> 105, match -> for)
Map(start -> 142, end -> 145, match -> only)

Note in particular that proofreading for wrong word errors thus generally requires not only checking the word itself, but also assessing the degree to which the word’s meaning and grammatical properties are appropriate for the context, which requires integration of information across multiple words. 
Map(start -> 37, end -> 39, match -> for)
Map(start -> 87, end -> 90, match -> only)
Map(start -> 219, end -> 221, match -> for)

Consequently, these errors should be different in at least two respects from nonword errors: (1) they should be more difﬁcult to detect because they require processing at multiple levels (i.e., checking orthographic legality, determining word status, and checking inter-word compatibility); and (2) proofreading for wrong-word errors should involve less reduction of deeper linguistic processing (both lexical and sentence level). 
Map(start -> 312, end -> 314, match -> for)

Theoretical framework With these considerations in mind, we now lay out a theoretical framework within which potential differences between various ‘‘reading’’ tasks, including normal reading for comprehension, proofreading to catch nonwords, and proofreading to catch wrong words, can be understood. 
Map(start -> 191, end -> 193, match -> for)

This framework is agnostic as to the speciﬁc model of eye movement control in reading (e.g., Bicknell & Levy, 2010; Engbert, Nuthmann, Richter, & Kliegl, 2005; Reichle, Pollatsek, Fisher, & Rayner, 1998; Reichle, Rayner, & Pollatsek, 2003; Schad & Engbert, 2012) assumed, although it should be noted that any complete model of reading must ultimately be able to account for task differences in reading behavior. 
Map(start -> 272, end -> 279, match -> although)
Map(start -> 370, end -> 372, match -> for)

Our starting desideratum is that any type of reading—be it normal reading, scanning (skimming the text to ﬁnd keywords), or proofreading—must involve some combination of (1) identifying words and (2) combining the meanings of those identiﬁed words to recover sentence meaning. 
Map(start -> 167, end -> 169, match -> of )

Each of (1) and (2) can be further broken into different components (Table 1). Word identiﬁcation involves both recognition of word-form and access of lexical content. 
Map(start -> 5, end -> 7, match -> of )

Word-form recognition can involve both decisions about whether or not the letter string is a word and, furthermore, what exact word it is. For example, wordhood assessment, which we deﬁne as recognizing whether the letter string has a legal (known) orthographic entry (similar to the ‘‘orthographic checking’’ process hypothesized by Kaakinen & Hyönä, 2010) is most obviously relevant for proofreading, but is also relevant even for normal reading since the reader must be able to deal with novel words. 
Map(start -> 229, end -> 231, match -> has)
Map(start -> 242, end -> 246, match -> known)
Map(start -> 385, end -> 387, match -> for)
Map(start -> 429, end -> 431, match -> for)

A reader may, for example, conclude that an incompletely identiﬁed letter string such as ‘‘qo###’’ is not a word (wordhood assessment without complete form validation), and may also correctly identify the exact letter sequence of a word such as ‘‘aortas’’ while failing to successfully match the sequence to an entry in his/her mental lexicon (correct form validation but incorrect wordhood assessment). 
Map(start -> 14, end -> 16, match -> for)

Sentence-level processing includes combining individual words’ content into larger, phrasal units (integration) and also assessment of whether each individual word is compatible with the rest of the sentence (word-context validation; essential for many types of error correction). 
Map(start -> 244, end -> 246, match -> for)

We further propose that readers adaptively shift the degree of engagement of each process so as to efﬁciently meet task goals (for further discussion see Section 1.4) without expenditure of undue amounts of cognitive resources (Table 1). It seems clear that all ﬁve of the above processes are relevant and have resources devoted to them during normal reading (hence the check marks in those cells in Table 1); we now turn to how, in different types of proofreading, they may differ in importance relative to normal reading. 
Map(start -> 127, end -> 129, match -> for)

When proofreading for errors that produce nonwords, the most obvious change is that both processes related to surface form—wordhood assessment and form validation—increase in importance (hence the up arrows in those cells in Table 1). It is unlikely, on the other hand, that these proofreaders would need to access content, integrate that content across words, or expend resources on word-context validation as thoroughly as during normal reading, because errors could be detected based almost exclusively on surface features and engaging in these processes might unnecessarily slow the proofreader down. 
Map(start -> 18, end -> 20, match -> for)

Thus, we predict that during proofreading for nonwords these processes would be either unchanged (represented by check marks) or de-emphasized (represented by down arrows) as compared with normal reading. 
Map(start -> 42, end -> 44, match -> for)

Proofreading for errors that produce wrong words, in contrast, would lead to a different prioritization of component processes: ﬁt into sentence context rather than surface features of words is the critical indicator of error status. 
Map(start -> 13, end -> 15, match -> for)
Map(start -> 153, end -> 163, match -> rather than)
Map(start -> 160, end -> 163, match -> than)

This task would de-emphasize (or leave unaffected) wordhood assessment, since wrong words still match to lexical entries, but more heavily emphasize form validation and content access (essential, for example, to identify an erroneous instance of trial that should have been trail,or vice versa). 
Map(start -> 196, end -> 198, match -> for)

However, it is unclear how sentence-level integration would be affected by proofreading for wrong words in comparison with normal reading (and so all three possibilities are represented): it might be enhanced by the need to perform effective word-context validation, it might be reduced since the depth of interpretation required for successful normal reading may not be necessary or worthwhile for adequate proofreading for wrong words, or it could remain unchanged. 
Map(start -> 88, end -> 90, match -> for)
Map(start -> 330, end -> 332, match -> for)
Map(start -> 395, end -> 397, match -> for)
Map(start -> 421, end -> 423, match -> for)

Now let us consider how the two linguistic properties we focus on in the present study—frequency and predictability—are likely to be implicated in the processes we have described above, and the implications for how the two types of proofreading tasks may modulate the effects of these variables on eye movement behavior. 
Map(start -> 207, end -> 209, match -> for)

Wordhood assessment and content access together are likely to implicate both frequency and predictability: frequent words may be easier to recognize as valid strings and to retrieve content for, and predictability effects reﬂect readers’ anticipation of upcoming meanings and word forms. 
Map(start -> 190, end -> 192, match -> for)

Wordhood assessment and content access need to occur when a word is ﬁrst encountered in order for understanding Table 1 Framework of some processes involved in normal reading and our hypotheses about how they change when proofreading for the two types of errors involved in Experiment 1 (nonwords) and Experiment 2 (wrong words).

Map(start -> 183, end -> 192, match -> hypotheses)
Map(start -> 234, end -> 236, match -> for)

Check marks in the reading column show that these processes are engaged and check marks for the proofreading columns show these processes are unchanged relative to normal reading. 
Map(start -> 88, end -> 90, match -> for)

Arrows show relative increases or decreases in the importance of (and thus amount of predicted reader engagement with) each component process relative to normal reading. 
Map(start -> 62, end -> 64, match -> of )

In sentence-level processing, however, predictability, which reﬂects degree of contextual ﬁt, is likely to be far more important than frequency: words with higher predictability are likely to be easier to integrate syntactically (Hale, 2001; Levy, 2008) and semantically (Kutas & Hillyard, 1984), and easier to validate as being a valid word, given the context and the visual input (Levy, Bicknell, Slattery, & Rayner, 2009). 
Map(start -> 30, end -> 36, match -> however)
Map(start -> 30, end -> 36, match -> however)
Map(start -> 129, end -> 132, match -> than)

Our framework leaves open a number of possibilities, but it also makes three clear predictions: (1) overall speed is likely to be slower in proofreading than in normal reading provided that errors are reasonably difﬁcult to spot and subjects proofread to a high degree of accuracy; (2) effects of proofreading for nonwords should show up (at least) in early eye-movement measures; and (3) predictability effects are more likely to be magniﬁed in proofreading for wrong words than in proofreading for nonwords. 
Map(start -> 153, end -> 156, match -> than)
Map(start -> 310, end -> 312, match -> for)
Map(start -> 459, end -> 461, match -> for)
Map(start -> 475, end -> 478, match -> than)
Map(start -> 496, end -> 498, match -> for)

Additionally, to avoid ceiling effects in error detection, subjects in these studies were generally told to emphasize speed, potentially de-emphasizing some of the processes that would otherwise be involved in the proofreading task (as predicted by the framework described above). 
Map(start -> 233, end -> 244, match -> as predicted)

From these studies, it is clear that the ability to detect spelling errors that are a result of letter substitutions or transpositions that produce nonwords (e.g., exict or exsit for exist; Healy, 1980, 1981; Holbrook, 1978a, 1978b)is fairly good, but depends on the similarity between wrong letters and intended letters (i.e., surface features of the word, relating to our hypothesized process of wordhood assessment). 
Map(start -> 179, end -> 181, match -> for)
Map(start -> 201, end -> 202, match -> , )

Furthermore, subjects are better able to detect nonword errors when the intended word is low frequency (e.g., sleat for sleet) than when it is high frequency (e.g., grean for green; Van Orden, 1991; see also Holbrook, 1978b; Jared, Levy, & Rayner, 1999), suggesting that subjects are more likely to coerce an errorful letter string into a real word if it is similar to a high frequency word (wordhood assessment and form validation may have been rushed and performed too cursorily). 
Map(start -> 116, end -> 118, match -> for)
Map(start -> 127, end -> 130, match -> than)
Map(start -> 171, end -> 173, match -> for)

Less detectable are wrong word errors (Daneman & Stainton, 1993; Levy et al., 1986), which moreover show differences in the contribution of phonological similarity to the intended word: homophone substitutions (e.g., mail for male) are less detectable than spelling control substitutions (e.g., mile; Banks, Oka, & Shugarman, 1981; Jared et al., 1999), potentially implicating that phonological status may mediate content access.

Map(start -> 344, end -> 345, match -> , )

The proofreading studies mentioned above generally focused on detection of errors, in terms of accuracy and detection time and can only tell us about whether or not proofreading was successful, not about how it modulated fundamental component processes of reading. 
Map(start -> 131, end -> 134, match -> only)
Map(start -> 178, end -> 180, match -> was)

A deeper understanding of this latter issue requires investigating how the reading of error-free words and sentences is affected by the instructions to look for errors. 
Map(start -> 2, end -> 24, match -> deeper understanding of)
Map(start -> 157, end -> 159, match -> for)

They had native Finnish speakers perform two tasks with Finnish sentences: ﬁrst, they read sentences for comprehension, answering occasional comprehension questions; then, they performed a proofreading task, in which they checked for misspellings of words that produced nonwords. 
Map(start -> 101, end -> 103, match -> for)
Map(start -> 230, end -> 232, match -> for)

They analyzed reading measures on sentences that did not contain errors, but did contain a frequency manipulation (as well as a length manipulation), ﬁnding an interaction between the frequency effect and task: frequency effects for gaze durations were larger in proofreading (141 ms for long words and 79 ms for short words) than in reading for comprehension (81 ms for long words and 30 ms for short words). 
Map(start -> 229, end -> 231, match -> for)
Map(start -> 284, end -> 286, match -> for)
Map(start -> 309, end -> 311, match -> for)
Map(start -> 326, end -> 329, match -> than)

Map(start -> 367, end -> 369, match -> for)
Map(start -> 392, end -> 394, match -> for)

One is that, as suggested by Kaakinen and Hyönä, word processing works qualitatively differently in proofreading than in reading for comprehension. 
Map(start -> 113, end -> 116, match -> than)
Map(start -> 129, end -> 131, match -> for)

That is, they perform task-sensitive word processing that leads to frequency information playing a larger role than in typical word identiﬁcation when proofreading for nonwords, but other properties (i.e., predictability) might remain unchanged (because frequency would be sufﬁcient for detecting errors). 
Map(start -> 111, end -> 114, match -> than)
Map(start -> 164, end -> 166, match -> for)
Map(start -> 283, end -> 285, match -> for)

It is also possible, however, that readers may have less ability to selectively change the way they process words in response to task demands. 
Map(start -> 21, end -> 27, match -> however)
Map(start -> 21, end -> 27, match -> however)

Instead, proofreading could work in a qualitatively similar way as reading for comprehension but demand that subjects become more conﬁdent than usual in word identities (to rule out visually similar nonword neighbors). 
Map(start -> 75, end -> 77, match -> for)
Map(start -> 139, end -> 142, match -> than)

Under this more cautious reading account, the ampliﬁcation of the frequency effect in proofreading is just a result of the longer processing time required for higher conﬁdence (e.g., the size of the effects may grow with increasing reading times) and we would expect to see similar changes in predictability effects in response to changes in task. 
Map(start -> 155, end -> 157, match -> for)

This account would be inconsistent with the theoretical framework we laid out above, which predicts that subcomponent processes are differentially modulated by proofreading in general. Thus, the task-sensitive word processing account predicts that proofreading for wrong words would amplify predictability effects whereas proofreading for nonwords would not. 
Map(start -> 22, end -> 33, match -> inconsistent)
Map(start -> 22, end -> 38, match -> inconsistent with)
Map(start -> 261, end -> 263, match -> for)
Map(start -> 335, end -> 337, match -> for)

On the other hand, if predictability effects increase in proofreading for both wrong word and nonword errors, it would lend support to the more cautious reading account and suggest that readers change how they process words in response to task demands in a global, less sophisticated way. 
Map(start -> 70, end -> 72, match -> for)

The ﬁrst goal was to conﬁrm the results of Kaakinen and Hyönä (2010) that frequency effects on non-error trials increase in proofreading for nonwords in another language (English). 
Map(start -> 14, end -> 16, match -> was)
Map(start -> 137, end -> 139, match -> for)

The second goal was to tease apart the task-sensitive word processing and more cautious reading accounts by determining whether predictability effects increase in the same way as frequency effects when subjects are proofreading for nonword errors. 
Map(start -> 16, end -> 18, match -> was)
Map(start -> 228, end -> 230, match -> for)

These ﬁrst two goals are tested in Experiment 1. The third goal was to compare how different types of proofreading tasks change these effects (i.e., checking for nonwords like trcak for track in Experiment 1 vs. checking for wrong words like trial for trail in Experiment 2) and to compare those results against the predictions of the theoretical framework described in Section 1.3.1.

In the ﬁrst experiment, subjects checked for spelling errors that produced nonwords (e.g., trcak instead of track), similar to the subjects in Kaakinen and Hyönä’s (2010) experiment.

Materials and design The stimuli/materials were adopted from four published studies to create three sets of stimuli that were fully counterbalanced across subject and task in the experiments (see Table 2): ﬁller items (error-free in the reading block and each item containing one error in the proofreading block; Appendix A), frequency items (high vs. low frequency; Appendix B), and predictability items (high vs. low predictability; Appendix C). Filler stimuli were 60 items taken from Johnson (2009), which investigated reading time on words that have a transposition letter neighbor (e.g., trail, which has the transposition neighbor trial) and control words that were matched on length, frequency, number of orthographic neighbors, number of syllables and ﬁt into the sentence, but did not have a transposition letter neighbor (e.g., track). 
Map(start -> 607, end -> 609, match -> has)

For the reading block, the sentences with the control word without a transposition letter neighbor were presented (e.g., ‘‘The runners trained for the marathon on the track behind the high school.’’). 
Map(start -> 119, end -> 120, match -> , )
Map(start -> 143, end -> 145, match -> for)

Error words were created by transposing two letters of the control words from Johnson (2009; e.g., track produced trcak; ‘‘The runners trained for the marathon on the trcak behind the high school.’’). 
Map(start -> 143, end -> 145, match -> for)

Frequency stimuli (which did not contain any errors) were 60 items taken from Drieghe, Rayner, and Pollatsek (2008; e.g., ‘‘The inner components are protected by a black metal/alloy increasing its lifespan.’’); two items were slightly modiﬁed by changing or adding a word that was not the target. 
Map(start -> 120, end -> 121, match -> , )
Map(start -> 277, end -> 279, match -> was)

For the ﬁnal set of items, target words were all ﬁve letters long; the high frequency words had a mean raw frequency of 94 per million (log frequency per million of 1.8 (SE = .05)) and low frequency words had a mean raw frequency of 7 per million (log frequency per 2 The fact that this control word (crab) has a transposition letter neighbor (carb) was an error in Johnson’s (2009) stimuli.

Predictability items (which also did not contain any errors) were taken from Rayner and Well (1996; 36 items) and Balota et al. (1985; 96 items; e.g., ‘‘The skilled gardener went outside to pull up the weeds/roses along the driveway.’’). 
Map(start -> 149, end -> 150, match -> , )

We performed two kinds of norming on this set: (1) cloze norming (N = 36), and (2) fragment plausibility norming (N = 50), in which subjects rated the plausibility of the fragment up to and including the critical words on a scale of 1–9. 
Map(start -> 230, end -> 232, match -> of )

To ensure the strength of the predictability manipulation with our subjects, we excluded any items for which more than one subject gave the low predictability completion in cloze. 
Map(start -> 99, end -> 101, match -> for)
Map(start -> 114, end -> 117, match -> than)

To ensure that the stimuli were not taken to be errors in the proofreading task, however, we also excluded any item that had plausibility lower than 6 in either condition.

For the ﬁnal set of 60 items (12 from Rayner and Well and 48 from Balota et al.), the high predictability condition had a mean cloze score of 0.64 (SE = .02) and a plausibility rating of 7.8 (SE = .1), and the low predictability condition had a mean cloze score of 0.008 (SE = .002) and a plausibility rating of 7.1 (SE = .1).

The experimental sentences were broken up into two blocks: reading for comprehension and proofreading. 
Map(start -> 67, end -> 69, match -> for)

Both the reading and proofreading blocks consisted of 30 frequency stimuli (15 high frequency, 15 low frequency), 30 predictability sentences (15 high predictability, 15 low predictability) and 30 items from Johnson (2009), which served as ﬁllers in the reading block (none contained errors) and errors in the proofreading block. 
Map(start -> 51, end -> 53, match -> of )
Map(start -> 112, end -> 113, match -> , )

These groups of items were fully counterbalanced in a Latin square design.

The sentence presentation for each condition was randomized.

Procedure At the start of the experiment, the eye-tracker was calibrated with a 3-point calibration scheme. 
Map(start -> 58, end -> 60, match -> was)

Subjects started with the reading block and were told to read the sentences for comprehension and to respond to occasional comprehension questions. 
Map(start -> 76, end -> 78, match -> for)

After each question, feedback was provided such that a correct answer would proceed to the next trial, whereas an incorrect response resulted in a screen presenting ‘‘INCORRECT!’’ for 3 s before advancing to a the next trial. Subjects received three practice trials before the reading block. 
Map(start -> 30, end -> 32, match -> was)
Map(start -> 180, end -> 182, match -> for)

In the proofreading block, subjects were instructed to proofread each sentence for spelling errors and after each sentence were prompted to respond whether or not there was a spelling error. 
Map(start -> 79, end -> 81, match -> for)
Map(start -> 169, end -> 171, match -> was)

There was feedback in proofreading the same as in reading. 
Map(start -> 6, end -> 8, match -> was)

Subjects were instructed to proofread ‘‘looking for spelling errors only.’’ At the beginning of this block, subjects received three practice trials (one of which had an error). 
Map(start -> 48, end -> 50, match -> for)
Map(start -> 68, end -> 71, match -> only)

Following Kaakinen and Hyönä (2010), the reading block was presented ﬁrst to avoid carryover effects because starting with the proofreading block may have prompted subjects to continue proofreading in the reading block. 
Map(start -> 55, end -> 57, match -> was)

Each trial began with a ﬁxation point in the center of the screen, which the subject was required to ﬁxate until the experimenter started the trial. Then a ﬁxation box appeared on the left side of the screen, located at the start of the sentence. 
Map(start -> 85, end -> 87, match -> was)

Once a ﬁxation was detected in this box, it disappeared and the sentence appeared. 
Map(start -> 15, end -> 17, match -> was)

The sentence was presented on the screen until the subject pressed a button signaling they completed reading the sentence. 
Map(start -> 13, end -> 15, match -> was)

For ﬁller items, in the reading block only the error-free control word version was seen whereas in the proofreading block the nonword error was seen in Experiment1 and the wrong word error was seen in Experiment 2. Target words are presented in italics.

For models that did not converge before reaching the iteration limit, we removed random effects that accounted for the least variance and did not signiﬁcantly improve the model’s ﬁt to the data iteratively until the model did converge.

3 In order to ﬁt the LMMs, the lmer function from the lme4 package (Bates, Maechler, & Bolker, 2011) was used within the R Environment for Statistical Computing (R Development Core Team, 2009).

Question accuracy Mean accuracy and error detection ability for proofreading are reported in Table 3. Overall, subjects performed very well both in the comprehension task (94% correct) and in the proofreading task (95% correct). 
Map(start -> 60, end -> 62, match -> for)

Eye movement measures Fixations shorter than 80 ms were combined with a previous or subsequent ﬁxation if they were within one character of each other or were eliminated. 
Map(start -> 40, end -> 43, match -> than)

Trials in which there was a blink or track loss during ﬁrst pass reading on the target word or during an immediately adjacent ﬁxation were removed (1% of the original number of trials). 
Map(start -> 22, end -> 24, match -> was)

For each ﬁxation duration measure, durations greater than 2.5 standard deviations from the subject’s mean (calculated separately across tasks) were also removed (less than 2% of the data from any measure were removed by this procedure). 
Map(start -> 53, end -> 56, match -> than)
Map(start -> 167, end -> 170, match -> than)

4 We analyzed six standard ﬁxation time measures (Rayner, 1998, 2009): ﬁrst pass measures, such as probability of making a ﬁrst-pass ﬁxation, ﬁrst ﬁxation duration (the duration of the ﬁrst ﬁxation on the target, regardless of how many ﬁxations are made), single ﬁxation duration (the duration of a ﬁxation on the target when only one ﬁxation is made), gaze duration (the sum of the duration of all ﬁxations made on the target before leaving it), as well as later measures, such as total viewing time (the sum of all ﬁxations on the target, including rereading of it after ﬁrst-pass reading) and go-past time (the sum of the duration of all ﬁxations on the target and any rereading of words to the left of it until the target is passed to the right).

For the models of the three-way interactions only the random slopes of the three-way interaction were used. 
Map(start -> 45, end -> 48, match -> only)

4 In addition to the target word, we analyzed reading time measures on the pre-target (Appendix D) and post-target word (Appendix E). For the pre-target word, almost all measures showed an effect of task, with longer reading times when subjects were proofreading than when they were reading, reﬂecting the same pattern seen on the target and in global reading measures. 
Map(start -> 263, end -> 266, match -> than)

For the main effects of frequency and predictability, signiﬁcant effects only appeared for regressions into the pre-target word, suggesting that these effects were driven subjects directly reading the target word. 
Map(start -> 73, end -> 76, match -> only)
Map(start -> 87, end -> 89, match -> for)

For the post-target word, there was a main effect of task for all measures in Experiment 2, but these effects were only signiﬁcant for late measures in Experiment 1. There were no signiﬁcant spillover effects of frequency for either Experiment.

There was a signiﬁcant spillover effect of predictability for regressions out of the posttarget word in Experiment 1 and for all effects but gaze duration in Experiment 2. There were signiﬁcant interactions between task and both of the manipulated variables for regressions out of the post-target word in Experiment 1. To assess how subjects approached the task of proofreading, we analyzed reading time measures on target words that did not contain an error (in either the reading or proofreading block) but did contain either a frequency (e.g., ‘‘The inner components are protected by a black metal/alloy increasing its lifespan.’’) or predictability manipulation (e.g., ‘‘The skilled gardener went outside to pull up the weeds/roses along the driveway.’’).

Fixation time measures.Results of the linear mixed effects analyses on ﬁxation time measures are reported in Table 5. There was a signiﬁcant effect of task for all ﬁxation time measures for sentences with a frequency manipulation (single ﬁxation duration: b = 8.86, t = 2.35; gaze duration: b = 14.71, t = 32.80; total time: b = 34.25, t = 4.63; go-past time: 34.79, t = 4.77) with the exception of ﬁrst ﬁxation duration (b = 4.26, t = 1.13) and for sentences with a predictability manipulation (ﬁrst ﬁxation duration: b = 12.17, t = 3.79; single ﬁxation duration: b = 13.53, t = 3.93; gaze duration: b = 14.15, t = 3.08; total time: b = 28.02, t = 3.68; go-past time: 17.97, t = 2.57), indicating that, when checking for nonword errors subjects spent longer on target words throughout their encounter with them (i.e., across all eye movement measures). 
Map(start -> 124, end -> 126, match -> was)
Map(start -> 156, end -> 158, match -> for)
Map(start -> 186, end -> 188, match -> for)
Map(start -> 446, end -> 448, match -> for)
Map(start -> 718, end -> 720, match -> for)

The effect of frequency was robustly found across all reading time measures (ﬁrst ﬁxation: b = 17.72, t = 5.17; single ﬁxation duration: b = 22.65, t = 5.91; gaze duration: b = 31.03, t = 6.04; total time: b = 35.43, t = 4.56; go-past time: b = 41.80, t = 5.25) as was the effect of predictability (ﬁrst ﬁxation duration: b = 12.22, t = 4.08: single ﬁxation duration: b = 14.95, t = 4.23; gaze duration: b = 13.71, t = 3.25; total time: b = 20.78, t = 3.85; go-past time: 22.71, t = 4.33). 
Map(start -> 24, end -> 26, match -> was)
Map(start -> 265, end -> 267, match -> was)

Of more interest for our present purposes are the interactions between task and our manipulations of frequency and predictability. 
Map(start -> 17, end -> 19, match -> for)

Here, the results are quite clear: frequency effects were reliably larger during proofreading than during reading across all measures (single ﬁxation duration: b = 13.12, t = 2.07; gaze duration: b = 29.91, t = 3.13; total time: b = 38.66, t = 2.52, go-past time: 34.86, t = 2.38) with the exception of ﬁrst ﬁxation duration (b = 3.92, t < 1) whereas the effect of predictability was not modulated by task in any ﬁxation time measure (all ts < 1.14). 
Map(start -> 94, end -> 97, match -> than)
Map(start -> 380, end -> 382, match -> was)

The interaction between task and the frequency effect in these data replicates Kaakinen and Hyönä’s result (in a different language: English), showing that the effect of frequency becomes larger when proofreading for spelling errors that produce nonwords (see goal 1, in Section 1.4). 
Map(start -> 213, end -> 215, match -> for)

In addition, the lack of an interaction with task for the predictability items helps to tease apart the possible interpretations of Kaakinen and Hyönä’s ﬁnding (see goal 2, in Section 1.4). 
Map(start -> 17, end -> 23, match -> lack of)
Map(start -> 50, end -> 52, match -> for)

While the more cautious reading account predicted that there should be a similar interaction for the predictability materials, instead, these data support the task-sensitive word processing account, in which subjects process words in proofreading in a qualitatively different way that makes more use of frequency information but does not make more use of predictability. 
Map(start -> 93, end -> 95, match -> for)

These data suggest that readers have a great deal of ﬂexibility with respect to how they process words depending on their speciﬁc goal, making more or less use of each property of a word (e.g., its frequency or predictability from context) dependent on that feature’s informativeness for the task at hand. 
Map(start -> 284, end -> 286, match -> for)

Fixation probability measures.Results of the logistic mixed-effects regression analyses on ﬁxation probability measures are reported in Table 6. As with the reading time measures, in Section 2.2.2.1, ﬁxation probability measures showed a robust effect of task, with a higher probability of ﬁxating the target (frequency items: z = 2.49, p = .01; predictability items: z = 3.77, p < .001), regressing into the Table 6 Results of the logistic regression mixed effects models for ﬁxation probability measures in Experiment 1. All measures were centered before being entered into the analyses.

Map(start -> 689, end -> 691, match -> for)

The only signiﬁcant interactions between task and our manipulations of frequency and predictability were on regressions into the target (frequency items: z = 2.63, p < .01; predictability items: z = 2.36, p < .001); all other interactions were not signiﬁcant (all ps > .17). 2.2.2.3. 
Map(start -> 4, end -> 7, match -> only)

In addition to the analyses reported in Section 2.2.2.1, we tested whether the interaction in the frequency stimuli was signiﬁcantly different from the null interaction in the predictability stimuli (i.e., the threeway interaction) in two key measures: gaze duration and total time. 
Map(start -> 116, end -> 118, match -> was)

These measures have been taken to reﬂect the time needed for initial word identiﬁcation (gaze duration) and to integrate the word into the sentence (total time). 
Map(start -> 57, end -> 59, match -> for)

The results of these analyses revealed a signiﬁcant threeway interaction for both gaze duration (b = 11.95, t = 2.01) and total time (b = 19.93, t = 2.27), conﬁrming our analyses above in suggesting that the effect of predictability did not increase in proofreading while the effect of frequency did. 
Map(start -> 73, end -> 75, match -> for)

Thus, our data do not show support for an account of proofreading in which subjects merely read more cautiously (and predictability effects would likewise increase) but rather support a qualitatively different type of task-sensitive word processing between reading for comprehension and proofreading. 
Map(start -> 35, end -> 37, match -> for)
Map(start -> 265, end -> 267, match -> for)

3. Experiment 2 As discussed in Section 1.3.1, when proofreading for errors that produce real, wrong words, one must take into account the sentence context. 
Map(start -> 65, end -> 67, match -> for)

Thus, one would expect that, when proofreading for wrong word errors, subjects may need to or want to take into account the predictability of a word more fully than they do when proofreading for nonword errors (as in Experiment 1 and Kaakinen & Hyönä, 2010). 
Map(start -> 47, end -> 49, match -> for)
Map(start -> 160, end -> 163, match -> than)
Map(start -> 191, end -> 193, match -> for)

We might expect, then, that if subjects can adapt how they process words to the ﬁne-grained demands of the task, then when proofreading for errors that produce actual words, subjects would show larger effects of predictability. 
Map(start -> 136, end -> 138, match -> for)

To test whether subjects adapt how they process words based on the precise nature of the spelling errors included in the stimuli, we ran a second experiment, similar to Experiment 1 except that, during proofreading, subjects checked for spelling errors (letter transpositions) that produced real, wrong words (e.g., trail produced trial; ‘‘The runners trained for the marathon on the trial behind the high school.’’). 
Map(start -> 3, end -> 14, match -> test whether)
Map(start -> 233, end -> 235, match -> for)
Map(start -> 360, end -> 362, match -> for)

We analyzed the same reading measures as in Experiment 1 to determine whether (a) frequency effects are increased when checking for errors that constitute real, but inappropriate words and (b) to determine whether predictability effects increase when task demands make predictability information useful.

Map(start -> 128, end -> 130, match -> for)
Map(start -> 193, end -> 212, match -> to determine whether)

Additionally, we analyzed global reading measures and local reading measures on target words in the ﬁller stimuli (ﬁllers during the reading task and errors during the proofreading task), comparing them between the two experiments, to assess the relative difﬁculty of proofreading for nonword errors and proofreading for wrong word errors.

Subjects A different set of 48 subjects, with the same selection criteria as Experiment 1 participated in Experiment 2. 3.1.2. 
Map(start -> 25, end -> 27, match -> of )

Materials The stimuli in Experiment 2 were identical to those in Experiment 1 except for the words that constituted errors in the proofreading task. 
Map(start -> 85, end -> 87, match -> for)

Error stimuli were produced by selecting the transposition letter neighbor of the target word (from Johnson, 2009), which was inappropriate in the sentence context (e.g., trail produced trial; ‘‘The runners trained for the marathon on the trial behind the high school.’’).

Map(start -> 215, end -> 217, match -> for)

Using these items from Johnson (2009) in both experiments meant that the base words from which the errors were formed were controlled across experiments for length, frequency, number of orthographic neighbors, number of syllables and ﬁt into the sentence. 
Map(start -> 153, end -> 155, match -> for)

Thus, the only difference between experiments was whether the transposition error happened to produce a real word. 
Map(start -> 10, end -> 13, match -> only)
Map(start -> 46, end -> 48, match -> was)

Procedure The procedure was identical to Experiment 1 except that, in the proofreading block, subjects were instructed that they would be ‘‘looking for misspelled words that spell check cannot catch. 
Map(start -> 24, end -> 26, match -> was)
Map(start -> 148, end -> 150, match -> for)

That is, these misspellings happened to produce an actual word but not the word that the writer intended.’’ and there were 5 practice trials (three errors) preceding the proofreading block instead of 3. 3.2. 
Map(start -> 197, end -> 199, match -> of )

Question accuracy As in Experiment 1, subjects performed very well both on the comprehension questions (93% correct) and in the proofreading task (91% correct; Table 3). In addition to overall accuracy, we used responses in the proofreading task to calculate d 0 scores (the difference between the z-transforms of the hit rate and the false alarm rate; a measure of error detection) for each subject and compared them between experiments using an independent samples t test. Proofreading accuracy was signiﬁcantly higher in Experiment 1 (M = 3.05, SE = .065) than in Experiment 2 (M = 2.53, SE = .073; t(93) = 5.37, p < .001), indicating that checking for real words that were inappropriate in the sentence context was more difﬁcult than checking for spelling errors that produce nonwords.

Experiment 1 revealed no evidence that the effect of the predictability of a word in the sentence differed in size between reading and proofreading (there was no interaction between predictability and task in any reading measure). 
Map(start -> 22, end -> 37, match -> no evidence that)
Map(start -> 155, end -> 157, match -> was)

Our interpretation of this result was that predictability information is not a more useful source of information when checking for nonwords as compared to when reading for comprehension.

Map(start -> 127, end -> 129, match -> for)
Map(start -> 168, end -> 170, match -> for)

However, when the errors that must be detected are real, wrong words, the only way to detect an error is to determine whether the word makes sense in the sentence context, making predictability a more relevant word property for error detection.

Map(start -> 105, end -> 124, match -> to determine whether)
Map(start -> 224, end -> 226, match -> for)

Thus, if our interpretation is correct that readers can qualitatively change the type of word processing they perform according to task demands, we may see the effect of predictability become larger in proofreading for wrong words (relative to reading). 
Map(start -> 215, end -> 217, match -> for)

Separate LMMs were ﬁt for frequency items and predictability items (except for the test of the three-way interaction, see Section 3.2.2.3). 3.2.2.1.

Fixation time measures.There was a signiﬁcant main effect of task for all ﬁxation time measures for sentences with a frequency manipulation (ﬁrst ﬁxation duration: b = 24.14, t = 5.49; single ﬁxation duration: b = 33.22, t = 5.77; gaze duration: b = 51.75, t = 8.25; total time: b = 155.25, t = 5.72; go-past time: b = 91.48, t = 6.00) and for sentences with a predictability manipulation (ﬁrst ﬁxation duration: b = 18.05, t = 4.87; single ﬁxation duration: b = 19.73, t = 4.95; gaze duration: b = 44.79, t = 6.99; total time: b = 112.78, t = 6.59; go-past time: 69.06, t = 6.08), indicating that, when checking for spelling errors that produce wrong words subjects took more time, spending longer on the target words throughout their encounter with them (i.e., across all eye movement measures). 
Map(start -> 29, end -> 31, match -> was)
Map(start -> 66, end -> 68, match -> for)
Map(start -> 96, end -> 98, match -> for)
Map(start -> 340, end -> 342, match -> for)
Map(start -> 613, end -> 615, match -> for)

Furthermore, the coefﬁcients that estimate the effect size are notably larger in the second experiment, when subjects were checking for more subtle errors (letter transpositions that produced real words that were inappropriate in the context). 
Map(start -> 132, end -> 134, match -> for)

The effect of frequency was robustly found across all reading time measures (ﬁrst ﬁxation: b = 10.35, t = 2.61; single ﬁxation duration: b = 14.73, t = 2.95; gaze duration: b = 25.56, t = 3.66; total time: b = 36.53, t = 2.33; go-past time: b = 47.18, t = 3.80) as was the effect of predictability (ﬁrst ﬁxation duration: b = 6.66, t = 2.08: single ﬁxation duration: b = 11.04, t = 3.12; gaze duration: b = 20.95, t = 4.14; total time: b = 49.27, t = 4.23; go-past time: 29.94, t = 3.13). 
Map(start -> 24, end -> 26, match -> was)
Map(start -> 265, end -> 267, match -> was)

Of more interest for our present purposes are the interactions between task and our manipulations of frequency and predictability. 
Map(start -> 17, end -> 19, match -> for)

Here, the results are quite clear: frequency effects were reliably larger during proofreading than reading across all measures (gaze duration: b = 26.51, t = 2.80; total time: b = 55.08, t = 2.21, go-past time: b = 41.51, t = 2.20) with the exception of ﬁrst ﬁxation duration (b = 3.98, t = 0.60) and single ﬁxation duration (b = 8.11, t = 0.98) whereas predictability was not modulated by task in any reading measure (all ts < 1.37) except for total time (b = 57.60, t = 2.72). 
Map(start -> 94, end -> 97, match -> than)
Map(start -> 369, end -> 371, match -> was)
Map(start -> 441, end -> 443, match -> for)

These data suggest that, when checking for spelling errors that produce real but inappropriate words, proofreaders still perform a qualitatively different type of word processing, which speciﬁcally ampliﬁes effects of word frequency. 
Map(start -> 39, end -> 41, match -> for)

However, while proofreaders do not appear to change their use of predictability during initial word recognition (i.e., ﬁrst pass reading), later word processing does show increased effects of how Table 9 Results of the logistic regression mixed effects models for ﬁxation probability measures in Experiment 2. All measures were centered before being entered into the analyses. 
Map(start -> 260, end -> 262, match -> for)

We return to the issue of why this effect only appears on a late measure in Section 4.2. 3.2.2.2. 
Map(start -> 42, end -> 45, match -> only)

Fixation probability measures.As with the reading time measures reported in Section 3.2.2.1, ﬁxation probability measures showed a robust effect of task, with a higher probability of ﬁxating the target (frequency items: z = 4.92, p < .001; predictability items: z = 5.41, p < .001), regressing into the target (frequency items: z = 5.60, p < .001; predictability items: z = 6.05, p < .001) and regressing out of the target (frequency items: z = 3.64, p < .001; predictability items: z = 4.15, p < .001) in the proofreading task than in the reading task. 
Map(start -> 528, end -> 531, match -> than)

There was a signiﬁcant interaction between task and frequency on the probability of ﬁxating the target (z = 2.14, p < .05) and a marginal interaction on the probability of regressing out of the target (z = 1.77, p = .08). 
Map(start -> 6, end -> 8, match -> was)

As in Experiment 1, we tested for the three-way interaction between target type (frequency vs. predictability), independent variable value (high vs. low) and task (reading vs. proofreading) to evaluate whether the interactions between independent variable and task were different between the frequency stimuli and the predictability stimuli. 
Map(start -> 30, end -> 32, match -> for)

As in Section 2.2.2.3, we tested for the three-way interaction in two key measures: gaze duration (Fig. 1) and total time (Fig. 2). The results of these analyses revealed that neither the three-way interaction for gaze duration (b = 5.59, t < 1) nor total time (b = 2.26, t < 1) were signiﬁcant, suggesting that, when proofreading for wrong word errors, subjects processed words in a way that magniﬁed the effects of both word frequency and predictability in a similar way. 
Map(start -> 33, end -> 35, match -> for)
Map(start -> 210, end -> 212, match -> for)
Map(start -> 331, end -> 333, match -> for)

However, when gaze duration was analyzed separately by stimulus set, the task by frequency interaction was signiﬁcant but the task by predictability interaction was not, and the three-way interaction, while not signiﬁcant, does suggest a trend in that direction. 
Map(start -> 28, end -> 30, match -> was)
Map(start -> 103, end -> 105, match -> was)
Map(start -> 161, end -> 163, match -> was)

Thus, the data suggest that, in ﬁrst pass reading, subjects certainly demonstrated increased sensitivity to frequency information (discussed above) and demonstrated only slight increased sensitivity to predictability information (certainly more than they demonstrated increased sensitivity to predictability information when proofreading in Experiment 1). However, the substantial interaction between task and predictability does not emerge until further inspection of the word (i.e., total time, see Section 4.2). 3.2.3.

Map(start -> 245, end -> 248, match -> than)

Comparisons between the two experiments The analyses reported in this section were performed on ﬁller items from the reading task and items that contained errors in the proofreading task to assess the degree to which proofreading sentences that actually contain errors differs from reading error-free sentences for comprehension. 
Map(start -> 311, end -> 313, match -> for)

When encountered in the reading block, sentences contained no errors and constituted the control sentences taken from Johnson (2009; i.e., ‘‘The runners trained for the marathon on the track behind the high school.’’). 
Map(start -> 137, end -> 138, match -> , )
Map(start -> 161, end -> 163, match -> for)

When encountered in the proofreading block, sentences contained errors; In Experiment 1 errors constituted nonwords (i.e., ‘‘The runners trained for the marathon on the trcak behind the high school.’’) and in Experiment 2 errors constituted wrong words (i.e., ‘‘The runners trained for the marathon on the trial behind the high school.’’).

Data for the reading task represent the average for a given condition across the two experiments.

Global reading measures.We analyzed two global reading measures: total sentence reading time (TSRT; the total amount of time spent reading the sentence) and reading rate (words per minute: WPM), which index general reading efﬁciency (Rayner, 1998, 2009), to assess the general difﬁculty of the proofreading task, compared to the reading task, across the two experiments (see Table 10). 
Map(start -> 246, end -> 247, match -> , )

The global reading measures conﬁrmed the results of the accuracy analyses: The proofreading task was more difﬁcult than the reading task, and this difference was more pronounced in the second experiment. 
Map(start -> 97, end -> 99, match -> was)
Map(start -> 115, end -> 118, match -> than)
Map(start -> 158, end -> 160, match -> was)

Both measures revealed signiﬁcant effects of task (TSRT: b = 814.8, t = 7.99; WPM: b = À53.18, t = À9.74), with the proofreading task leading to less efﬁcient (slower) reading (M TSRT = 2986 ms; M WPM = 299 in Experiment 1 M TSRT = 4320 ms; M WPM = 226 in Experiment 2) than the reading for comprehension task (M TSRT = 2699 ms; M WPM = 327 in Experiment 1 M TSRT = 2970 ms; M WPM = 304 in Experiment 2). Both measures also revealed a signiﬁcant effect of experiment (TSRT: b = 801.7, t = 4.00; WPM: b = À47.84, t = À3.06), with less efﬁcient reading in the second experiment than in the ﬁrst experiment.

Map(start -> 287, end -> 289, match -> for)
Map(start -> 576, end -> 579, match -> than)

More importantly, there was a signiﬁcant interaction in both measures (TSRT: b = 1063.1, t = 5.23; WPM: b = À49.85, t = À4.62), with the effect of task (reading vs. proofreading) larger in the second experiment (when proofreading involved checking for wrong words) than in the ﬁrst experiment (when proofreading involved checking for nonwords).

Local reading measures.To assess how task demands change processing of the target words themselves (i.e., the only word that differed between tasks and between experiments in the proofreading task) we analyzed local reading measures (the same as mentioned above) on the ﬁller trials; Tables 10–12. 
Map(start -> 110, end -> 113, match -> only)

All analyses revealed a signiﬁcant effect of task (for all ﬁxation time measures, all ts > 12; for all ﬁxation probability measures, all ps < .001) with longer reading times on and higher probabilities of ﬁxating and regressing into or out of the target Fig. 2.

There were signiﬁcant differences between experiments in gaze duration and total time (both ts > 2.09), as well as the probability of regressing out of and into the target (both ps < .001), but not for any of the other ﬁxation time measures (all ts < 1.77) or the probability of ﬁxating the target (p = .32).

Analyses of ﬁxation time measures revealed signiﬁcant but qualitatively different interactions between task and experiment for early and late reading measures.

There were signiﬁcant interactions for early reading measures (ﬁrst ﬁxation duration: b = À19.24, t = 2.25; single ﬁxation duration: b = À31.18, t = 2.78; gaze duration: b = À45.41, t = 3.18) with a larger increase in reading time in the proofreading block when checking for nonword errors (Experiment 1) than when checking for wrong word errors (Experiment 2; see Fig. 1). These data suggest that, upon initial inspection of the words, errors were detected (and produced longer reading times) more easily when they resulted in nonwords than when they resulted in wrong words.

Here, reading time on the target increased more in the proofreading block when checking for wrong words (Experiment 2) than when checking for nonwords (Experiment 1) for total time on the target (b = 191.27, t = 3.88; see Fig. 2) but not signiﬁcantly in go-past time (t < .32).

There was no signiﬁcant interaction between task and experiment on the probability of ﬁxating or regressing into the target (both ps > .14) but there was a signiﬁcant interaction on the probability of regressing out of the target (z = 2.92, p < .001) with a small increase in regressions out of the target in Experiment 1 (.07 in reading compared to .08 in proofreading) and a large effect in Experiment 2 (.09 in reading compared to .18 in proofreading).

Based on consideration of ﬁve component processes central to normal reading—wordhood assessment, form validation, content access, integration, and word-context validation—and how different types of proofreading are likely to emphasize or de-emphasize each of these component processes, this framework made three basic predictions regarding the outcome of our two experiments, each of which was conﬁrmed. 
Map(start -> 390, end -> 392, match -> was)

First, overall speed should be slower in proofreading than in normal reading, provided that errors are reasonably difﬁcult to spot and that readers proofread accurately. 
Map(start -> 54, end -> 57, match -> than)

The errors we introduced into our stimuli all involved single word-internal letter swaps expected a priori to be difﬁcult to identify, and our readers achieved very high accuracy in proofreading—higher in Experiment 1 (95%) than in Experiment 2 (91%). 
Map(start -> 224, end -> 227, match -> than)

Consistent with our framework’s predictions under these circumstances, overall reading speed (e.g., TSRT – total sentence reading time) was slower during proofreading than during normal reading in both experiments. 
Map(start -> 136, end -> 138, match -> was)
Map(start -> 167, end -> 170, match -> than)

(Note, however, that the two types of proofreading interacted in slightly different ways with word frequency; see Section 4.2 for further discussion.) However, we must also note that even tasks that should be less onerous than reading (e.g., x-string scanning) can lead to longer reading times (Rayner & Fischer, 1996). 
Map(start -> 7, end -> 13, match -> however)
Map(start -> 7, end -> 13, match -> however)
Map(start -> 126, end -> 128, match -> for)
Map(start -> 222, end -> 225, match -> than)

Second, our framework predicted that effects of proofreading for nonwords should not show up exclusively in late measures, since proofreading for nonwords should emphasize word identiﬁcation processes, which must occur upon ﬁrst encountering a word. 
Map(start -> 61, end -> 63, match -> for)
Map(start -> 142, end -> 144, match -> for)

Third, our framework predicted that predictability effects should be magniﬁed more in proofreading for wrong words than in proofreading for nonwords, since proofreading for wrong words emphasizes processes that intrinsically implicate the degree of ﬁt between a word and the rest of the sentence, (e.g., word-context validation and integration), but proofreading for nonwords does not. 
Map(start -> 99, end -> 101, match -> for)
Map(start -> 115, end -> 118, match -> than)
Map(start -> 136, end -> 138, match -> for)
Map(start -> 169, end -> 171, match -> for)
Map(start -> 363, end -> 365, match -> for)

Indeed, whereas when proofreading for nonwords (Experiment 1) the task (reading vs. proofreading) never interacted with predictability, when proofreading for wrong words (Experiment 2) task and predictability interacted in regressions into and total time on the target word. 
Map(start -> 34, end -> 36, match -> for)
Map(start -> 154, end -> 156, match -> for)

Instead, we see different effects on predictability in proofreading for nonwords vs. proofreading for wrong words, consistent with our framework. 
Map(start -> 68, end -> 70, match -> for)
Map(start -> 98, end -> 100, match -> for)

Further results interpretable within the framework The other major results in our data, though not directly predicted by our framework, can be readily understood within it. First, Experiment 1 afﬁrms Kaakinen and Hyönä’s (2010) original result that frequency effects are larger in proofreading for nonwords, showing that the pattern they found in Finnish also holds in English. 
Map(start -> 294, end -> 296, match -> for)

Experiment 2 extended this result to the case of proofreading for spelling errors that produce real words. 
Map(start -> 62, end -> 64, match -> for)

These results were supported by interactions between frequency effects and task (in both early and late reading measures) for error-free trials. 
Map(start -> 122, end -> 124, match -> for)

In Experiment 1 (proofreading for nonwords), task did not affect reading speed on high frequency words, but did slow reading of low frequency words. 
Map(start -> 30, end -> 32, match -> for)

To investigate this, we performed analyses separately on high frequency words and low frequency words, testing for the effects of task (reading vs. proofreading), experiment, and the interaction between them (with linear mixed effects models with the maximal random effects structure) and follow-up paired comparisons between reading times on either high frequency words or low frequency words (analyzed separately) as a function of task. 
Map(start -> 111, end -> 113, match -> for)

For gaze duration, the main effect of task among only high frequency words was not signiﬁcant in Experiment 1 (t = 0.13) but was signiﬁcant in Experiment 2 (t = 5.61), conﬁrming that high frequency words were unaffected by proofreading for nonwords (the same pattern of data was observed for other reading time measures). 
Map(start -> 49, end -> 52, match -> only)
Map(start -> 75, end -> 77, match -> was)
Map(start -> 125, end -> 127, match -> was)
Map(start -> 236, end -> 238, match -> for)
Map(start -> 275, end -> 277, match -> was)
Map(start -> 288, end -> 290, match -> for)

For gaze duration for low frequency words, the main effect of task was signiﬁcant in both Experiment 1 (t = 3.72) and Experiment 2 (t = 7.89), conﬁrming that they were always affected by task, regardless of what type of proofreading was being performed (the same pattern of data was observed for all other reading time measures except the effect of task was not signiﬁcant on ﬁrst ﬁxation duration for Experiment 1 or go-past time in Experiment 2). Although this difference is not directly predicted within our framework, it is compatible with it: the result implies that wordhood assessment, the sole frequency-sensitive process emphasized in proofreading for nonwords, is of only minimal difﬁculty for high frequency words but that content access, the sole frequency-sensitive process emphasized in proofreading for wrong words, is of nonminimal difﬁculty even for high frequency words. 
Map(start -> 18, end -> 20, match -> for)

Map(start -> 279, end -> 281, match -> was)

Map(start -> 814, end -> 816, match -> for)
Map(start -> 863, end -> 865, match -> for)

Third is the question of why predictability effects were unchanged in proofreading for nonwords, rather than being magniﬁed (to a lesser degree than in proofreading for wrong words) or reduced. 
Map(start -> 83, end -> 85, match -> for)
Map(start -> 97, end -> 107, match -> rather than)
Map(start -> 104, end -> 107, match -> than)
Map(start -> 144, end -> 147, match -> than)
Map(start -> 165, end -> 167, match -> for)

We also consider it unlikely that sentence-level integration is completely shut off even during proofreading for nonwords; given that one basic consequence of linguistic context in reading is that it allows for reading to proceed more quickly (Bicknell & Levy, 2012; Ehrlich & Rayner, 1981; Morton, 1964; Rayner & Well, 1996), it makes sense that subjects would continue to use linguistic context during word processing (and thus show predictability effects) in order to proofread more quickly. 
Map(start -> 109, end -> 111, match -> for)
Map(start -> 207, end -> 209, match -> for)

Interestingly, one of the differences between our (and Kaakinen & Hyönä’s, 2010) proofreading paradigm and the other proofreading studies described in Section 1.3.2 is that the other experiments often emphasized speed as opposed to accuracy (to avoid ceiling effects since their dependent measure was percent detection). 
Map(start -> 46, end -> 49, match -> our )
Map(start -> 46, end -> 49, match -> our )
Map(start -> 297, end -> 299, match -> was)

We must also address the fact that predictability effects were modulated only for late measures, not for early measures, in Experiment 2. Once again, this result is not directly predicted by our framework, but is compatible with it. One possibility is that subjects in our study may have been hesitant to ﬂag an unpredictable word as an error until they see the context words to the right (or reread context to the left). 
Map(start -> 73, end -> 76, match -> only)
Map(start -> 78, end -> 80, match -> for)
Map(start -> 101, end -> 103, match -> for)

This happened not only after misses (i.e., failing to respond that there was an error when there was one) but also after false alarms (i.e., responding that there was an error when there was not). 
Map(start -> 18, end -> 21, match -> only)
Map(start -> 73, end -> 75, match -> was)
Map(start -> 97, end -> 99, match -> was)
Map(start -> 163, end -> 165, match -> was)
Map(start -> 187, end -> 189, match -> was)

For example, the error ‘‘The marathon runners trained on the trial...’’ could be salvaged with a continuation such as ‘‘...course behind the high school.’’ Obviously, subjects would not know this without reading the rest of the sentence and may, for all sentences, continue reading to become more conﬁdent whether the sentence contained an error or not. 
Map(start -> 246, end -> 248, match -> for)

Finally, we note that several aspects of our data conﬁrm that proofreading is more difﬁcult when spelling errors produce wrong words (e.g., trial for trail) compared to when they produce nonwords (e.g., trcak for track). 
Map(start -> 146, end -> 148, match -> for)
Map(start -> 209, end -> 211, match -> for)

First, d 0 scores for proofreading accuracy when checking for wrong words (Experiment 2) were lower than d 0 scores when checking for nonwords (Experiment 1; see Table 1). Furthermore, this difference was driven by poorer performance correctly identifying errors (81% in Experiment 2 compared to 89% in Experiment 1) rather than performance correctly identifying error-free sentences (98% vs. 97%). 
Map(start -> 18, end -> 20, match -> for)
Map(start -> 58, end -> 60, match -> for)
Map(start -> 100, end -> 103, match -> than)
Map(start -> 130, end -> 132, match -> for)
Map(start -> 201, end -> 203, match -> was)
Map(start -> 317, end -> 327, match -> rather than)
Map(start -> 324, end -> 327, match -> than)

Second, reading efﬁciency (total sentence reading time and reading rate) was poorer when proofreading for wrong words than when proofreading for nonwords. 
Map(start -> 73, end -> 75, match -> was)
Map(start -> 102, end -> 104, match -> for)
Map(start -> 118, end -> 121, match -> than)
Map(start -> 141, end -> 143, match -> for)

Our framework made no direct predictions regarding this result, but it follows naturally from consideration of what information sources are required to detect each type of error. 
Map(start -> 136, end -> 147, match -> are required)

Identifying a nonword error requires only successful wordhood assessment—which can be done without regard for context but which context may nevertheless be helpful for—while identifying a wrong word error requires successful word-context validation. 
Map(start -> 37, end -> 40, match -> only)
Map(start -> 106, end -> 108, match -> for)
Map(start -> 140, end -> 151, match -> nevertheless)
Map(start -> 164, end -> 166, match -> for)

Thus, more information sources support nonword identiﬁcation than support wrong word identiﬁcation. 
Map(start -> 61, end -> 64, match -> than)

These data suggest that subjects were primarily assessing wordhood through a full check against the lexicon or against context, rather than purely checking surface features such as pronounceability. 
Map(start -> 128, end -> 138, match -> rather than)
Map(start -> 135, end -> 138, match -> than)

As mentioned above, though, the errors in Experiment 1 were easier to detect than those in Experiment 2, suggesting that the need to integrate the word with the sentence context in order to identify whether it is an error was likely what made the proofreading task in Experiment 2 more difﬁcult. 
Map(start -> 77, end -> 80, match -> than)
Map(start -> 222, end -> 224, match -> was)

We saw that the size of the frequency effect increased when proofreading for any type of spelling error, reﬂecting the fact that word frequency is useful for detecting violations of word status (i.e., nonwords do not have a detectable word frequency), which might be a ﬁrst step in checking for spelling errors. 
Map(start -> 73, end -> 75, match -> for)
Map(start -> 154, end -> 156, match -> for)
Map(start -> 291, end -> 293, match -> for)

Likewise, when the relationship between words was crucial to identify spelling errors (in Experiment 2), we saw that the magnitude of the predictability effect increased, as well. 
Map(start -> 46, end -> 48, match -> was)

As another example from the reading domain, Radach, Huestegge, and Reilly (2008) presented data suggesting that frequency effects are larger when readers expect comprehension questions than when they expect word veriﬁcation questions (although the interaction was not signiﬁcant). 
Map(start -> 185, end -> 188, match -> than)
Map(start -> 235, end -> 242, match -> although)
Map(start -> 260, end -> 262, match -> was)

Taken together, these results and ours ﬁt naturally with claims that readers optimize how they read for their particular goals (Bicknell & Levy, 2010; Lewis, Shvartsman, & Singh, 2013) and that reading behavior can be well described as adaptive. 
Map(start -> 100, end -> 102, match -> for)

The general framework we introduced for understanding task-speciﬁc modulations in different component processing of reading, which predicted several of the key ﬁndings of our experiments and shed light on several more, may prove to be of further use in understanding modulations of reading behavior with other tasks, such as different types of proofreading (e.g., word-position errors) and scanning for keywords.
