Although centrioles usually organize only small amounts of PCM in interphase cells, the PCM expands dramatically as cells prepare to enter mitosis—a process termed centrosome maturation (Khodjakov and Rieder, 1999).
Many PCM proteins, however, can be recruited to mitotic centrosomes in the absence of Cnn, albeit at reduced levels (Lucas and Raff, 2007), suggesting that at least one other protein must be able to form a scaffold around centrioles that can recruit other PCM components.
Nevertheless, it was clear from recovery profiles that the PCM fraction of D-PLP-GFP did not initially recover centrally and then move outwards, but rather recovered throughout the PCM volume.
DSpd-2-GFP had a similar distribution with several spoke-like projections extending from a central ring (Figure 3C), although, in agreement with our radial profiling data, much less DSpd-2 extended into the more peripheral regions of the PCM (Figure 3C).
Thus, although the centrosomal binding sites for DSpd-2 and Cnn appear to be concentrated around the mother centriole, they do not precisely overlap and they recruit DSpd-2 and Cnn at different rates, strongly suggesting that DSpd-2 and Cnn are not incorporated into the PCM together as part of the same complex.
Anti-Asl antibodies bound to centrosomes and reduced the rate of DSpd-2-GFP incorporation into the PCM by ∼75%, whereas anti-DSas-4 and anti-D-PLP antibodies had little effect (Figure 5)—although these antibodies bound to centrioles/centrosomes and at least partially disrupted the function of their cognate protein (Basto et al., 2008; Novak et al., 2014; unpublished data).
Although we cannot be certain that Asl and DSpd-2 interact directly in vivo, collectively our data indicate that Asl has an important, and potentially direct, role in recruiting DSpd-2 to mother centrioles in fly embryos.10.7554/eLife.03399.013Video 3.(related to Figure 5).
We noticed, however, that the distribution of DSpd-2-GFP, but not Asl-GFP, around the mother centriole closely matched the distribution of the initial binding sites for GFP-Cnn, as revealed by our 3D-SIM FRAP experiments (compare the recovering GFP-Cnn signal at t = 60 s in Figure 4B to the unbleached DSpd-2-GFP signal at t = −30 s in Figure 4A; also compare the average profile of DSpd-2-GFP to the average initial recovery profile of GFP-Cnn, Figure 4D).
Although we cannot be certain that Cnn and DSpd-2 interact directly in vivo, collectively our data indicate that DSpd-2 has an important, and potentially direct, role in recruiting Cnn to mother centrioles in fly embryos, while Asl appears to have a more minor role.
Although there was a dramatic reduction in the amount of DSpd-2-GFP associated with centrosomes in the absence of Cnn (Figure 8A,B), FRAP experiments revealed that the initial rate of DSpd-2-GFP incorporation was unperturbed (Figure 8C–E).
Both proteins have been implicated in PCM recruitment, so we reasoned that such scaffolds might provide a platform on which other PCM proteins assemble during mitosis.To test this idea, we analyzed larval brain cells where centrioles organize almost no PCM or MTs during interphase but mature to organize large amounts of both during mitosis (Martinez-Campos et al., 2004; Rogers et al., 2008; Figure 9A).
Remarkably, however, centrosome maturation appeared to be abolished in the mitotic brain cells lacking both Cnn and DSpd-2 (Figure 9D,H).
In live mitotic brain cells co-expressing the centriolar marker GFP-PACT and the MT marker Jupiter-mCherry (Figure 9—figure supplement 2; Video 5), centrosomes with MT asters were detectable in almost all cells lacking either Cnn (n = 18/18) or DSpd-2 (n = 24/25), but in almost no cells lacking both proteins (n = 1/24).
No centrosomal MT asters, however, can be observed in cnn;dspd-2 double mutant neuroblasts and the spindle appears to form independently of centrosomes (D).DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03399.022
DSpd-2 and Cnn partially depend on each other for their centrosomal localization, and both proteins are required to ensure robust centrosome maturation.
Although, we have identified direct interactions between Asl and DSpd-2 and between DSpd-2 and Cnn by Y2H, and the endogenous proteins can all co-immunoprecipitate with one another in fly embryo extracts (Conduit et al., 2010; Gopalakrishnan et al., 2011), we stress that we cannot be certain that these interactions are direct in vivo.
We recently showed that although Asl is essential for centriole duplication, it is not incorporated into daughter centrioles until they have passed through mitosis and matured into new mother centrioles (Novak et al., 2014), and Asl/Cep152 proteins mainly localize to mother centrioles in several species (Sir et al., 2011; Fu and Glover, 2012; Lawo et al., 2012; Mennella et al., 2012; Sonnen et al., 2012).
Although DSpd-2 seems to be the major recruiter of centrosomal Cnn in embryos, there must be an alternative recruiter, as the centrosomal localization of Cnn is not abolished in the absence of DSpd-2 (Figure 7, Figure 9C).
Asl is an attractive candidate as anti-Asl antibodies perturb Cnn recruitment to centrioles (Conduit et al., 2010) (although this could be an indirect consequence of their effect on DSpd-2 recruitment), and Asl and Cnn interact in our Y2H analysis.
It remains unclear, however, whether DSpd-2 itself can form a scaffold, or whether it requires other proteins to do so.
Moreover, mutations in human Cdk5Rap2/Cnn have been implicated in microcephaly (Bond et al., 2005), a pathology linked to a failure in neural progenitor cell proliferation, although the precise reason for this is unclear (Bond and Woods, 2006; Megraw et al., 2011).
Although DSpd-2 and Cnn have a major role in centrosome maturation, we stress that other PCM components are likely to make important contributions.
These centriolar fibrils, however, cannot explain how centrioles organize such a vastly expanded PCM matrix during mitosis, and D-PLP appears to have an important, but more minor, role in mitotic PCM assembly in vivo (Martinez-Campos et al., 2004).
Nevertheless, proteins like D-PLP will certainly help recruit other PCM proteins and help form structural links within the PCM, thus strengthening the mitotic PCM matrix.
To our knowledge, however, no PCM component has yet been shown to assemble from the inside out and to flux away from the centrioles in any other system.
Nevertheless, although the precise molecular details will likely vary from cell type to cell type and from species to species, we suspect that this unusual dynamic behaviour of an underlying mitotic PCM scaffold will prove to be a general feature of mitotic centrosome assembly in many systems.
