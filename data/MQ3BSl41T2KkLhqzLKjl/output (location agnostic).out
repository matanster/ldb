1 What is surprising observers at present, however, is the strength of U.S. productivity since the end of the 2001 recession.

This development is less well understood and has important implications for our understanding of U.S. productivity trends now and in the future.

In this edition of Current Issues, we seek to shed light on the recent performance of U.S. productivity growth.

Significantly, however, the drop-off in productivity in 2001 was not as large as it had been in earlier recessions and the productivity recovery was much stronger (Chart 1).

The Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research, for example, pointed to the gap between output and employment growth in 2002 and early 2003 as a major problem in dating the end of the 2001 recession.

Explaining U.S.Productivity Growth We employ standard growth accounting techniques to decompose the growth of productivity into its components, or sources.Specifically, we quantify the proximate contributions of increased inputs of labor and capital services and other factors.

This allows us to quantify the technological progress in the production of IT equipment and software—for example, the ability to produce faster and more powerful computers at lower prices.

Capital deepening made the largest contribution, accounting for 1.21 percentage points of the total increase.

Total factor productivity was next, contributing 0.74 percentage point, and labor quality followed with a contribution of 0.26 percentage point.This ranking, which holds for each subperiod and the post-1995 acceleration, underscores the importance of investment and capital allocation for productivity growth.

This sizable contribution reflects the Table 1 Sources of U.S.

The contribution of an input reflects the share-weighted growth rate.Capital is broadly defined to include business capital and consumer durables.

Similarly, 60 percent of the increased capital deepening in 1995-2003 was attributable to IT, although information processing equipment and software accounted for only about one-quarter of private fixed investments in this period.

This large contribution reflects both the rapid accumulation of IT capital as prices fell and IT capital’s high marginal product.

A brief look at the economics underlying our findings may shed light on the complex role of IT.

This massive investment in IT leads to the large contribution of IT capital deepening to labor productivity growth.

Significantly, however, labor productivity now shows a larger increase—1.57 percentage points, compared with 0.92 percentage point in our 2002 estimates—reflecting relatively strong growth in 2001, 2002, and 2003, as well as revisions to the underlying data.

Both IT and non-IT capital are now larger, although this result partly reflects differences in our methodology.

The contribution of labor quality to the post-1995 revival is essentially unchanged.

Finally, the contribution of TFP associated with IT production has not changed, while we now see a much larger contribution from non-IT TFP growth.

11 Intel, however, has recently announced its intention to maintain a two-year product cycle (Lammers 2004).

In all cases, the contribution of IT to aggregate TFP growth reflects the 1995-2003 average output share of each IT component.

The TFP contribution from non-IT sources is more difficult to project because the post-1995 performance has been so uneven.

Our base case uses the average non-IT TFP contribution observed in the full 1990-2003 period.

Our optimistic case assumes that the larger contribution seen in 1995-2003 will continue for the intermediate future,while our pessimistic case assumes that the non-IT TFP contribution will revert to its value during the slow-growth period of 1973-95.

These projections reflect the slackening pace of technological progress in semiconductors and put the contribution of IT-related TFP slightly below that of 1995-2003 as the semiconductor industry eventually returns to a three-year product cycle.

Slower growth is partly offset by a larger IT output share.Other TFP growth also makes a smaller contribution.

The larger share of IT, however, means that even with slower capital quality growth, slower labor quality growth, and slower TFP growth, labor productivity growth will be near the rates seen in the 1970s and 1980s.

12 These positive effects, however, are likely to be tempered by demographic trends.

The pessimistic case uses 1973-95 average growth of IT-related TFP growth, the non-IT TFP contribution, and capital quality growth.

We emphasize, however, that there is considerable uncertainty in these projections.
