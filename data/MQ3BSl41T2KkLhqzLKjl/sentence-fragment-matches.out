1 What is surprising observers at present, however, is the strength of U.S. productivity since the end of the 2001 recession.

This development is less well understood and has important implications for our understanding of U.S. productivity trends now and in the future.

In this edition of Current Issues, we seek to shed light on the recent performance of U.S. productivity growth.
Map(start -> 4, end -> 7, match -> this)

We begin with a comparison of U.S.productivity growth during the 2001 business cycle and earlier cycles.
Map(start -> 28, end -> 29, match -> of)
Map(start -> 62, end -> 64, match -> the)


We then extend through 2003 our earlier analysis of the sources of productivity growth and document the changing factors that explain the robust performance in recent years.

Map(start -> 101, end -> 103, match -> the)
Map(start -> 135, end -> 137, match -> the)


Finally, we use our findings to update our medium-term projections for U.S.labor productivity growth for the U.S.private economy.
Map(start -> 17, end -> 19, match -> our)
Map(start -> 40, end -> 42, match -> our)
Map(start -> 68, end -> 70, match -> for)
Map(start -> 102, end -> 104, match -> for)
Map(start -> 106, end -> 108, match -> the)


We project labor productivity growth of 2.6 percent per year for the next decade, a significant increase from our earlier projection of 2.2 percent.

Map(start -> 134, end -> 135, match -> of)


Moreover, we identify important changes in the underlying sources of growth.
Map(start -> 44, end -> 46, match -> the)
Map(start -> 67, end -> 68, match -> of)


On the positive side, the continued strength of technological progress and the importance of investment in IT equipment and software suggest higher trend productivity growth.

Map(start -> 23, end -> 25, match -> the)

Map(start -> 63, end -> 70, match -> progress)
Map(start -> 76, end -> 78, match -> the)
Map(start -> 91, end -> 92, match -> of)


On the negative side, the aging of the U.S. labor force continues to act as a drag on productivity advances as the growth in labor quality slows.

Map(start -> 112, end -> 114, match -> the)


On net, these developments are favorable for the U.S. economy and support the view that the technology-led productivity revival will continue.

Recent Productivity Trends The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is the official source of data on U.S.labor productivity (output per hour worked) for the business, nonfarm business, and manufacturing sectors of the U.S.economy.

Map(start -> 212, end -> 214, match -> the)


Recent BLS estimates (U.S.Department of Labor 2004), released in October 2004 for the period through second-quarter 2004, show that productivity growth since 1995 has been more than twice the average of the previous two decades (Chart 1).
Map(start -> 38, end -> 39, match -> of)
Map(start -> 52, end -> 52, match -> ,)
Map(start -> 79, end -> 81, match -> for)

Map(start -> 201, end -> 202, match -> of)
Map(start -> 204, end -> 206, match -> the)

To be precise, productivity growth increased from 1.5 percent per year in the period from fourth-quarter 1973 to fourth-quarter 1995 to 3.1 percent per year in the period from fourth-quarter 1995 to second-quarter 2004.

Map(start -> 160, end -> 162, match -> the)


Between the first quarter of 1969 and 2002, for example, there was no eightyear period in which productivity growth exceeded 3.0 percent.

While the post-1995 period includes the boom of the late 1990s, it also includes the NASDAQ collapse in 2000, the 2001 recession, the September 11 terrorist attacks, an investment bust, corporate accounting scandals, the war in Iraq, and rising oil prices.

The increasing strength of productivity through this period is nothing short of astonishing.

Map(start -> 78, end -> 79, match -> of)


The resilience of productivity growth is also evident in its behavior around business cycle changes.
Map(start -> 16, end -> 17, match -> of)


In the 2001 recession, as in earlier downturns, productivity growth slowed at the onset of the economyâ€™s decline and accelerated afterwards.

Map(start -> 79, end -> 81, match -> the)
Map(start -> 89, end -> 90, match -> of)
Map(start -> 92, end -> 94, match -> the)


Significantly, however, the drop-off in productivity in 2001 was not as large as it had been in earlier recessions and the productivity recovery was much stronger (Chart 1).
Map(start -> 16, end -> 22, match -> however)
Map(start -> 25, end -> 27, match -> the)
Map(start -> 62, end -> 64, match -> was)
Map(start -> 66, end -> 68, match -> not)
Map(start -> 120, end -> 122, match -> the)
Map(start -> 146, end -> 148, match -> was)

A closer examination of productivity performance around recent recessions confirms this finding (Chart 2): Three years after the 2001 recession began, nonfarm productivity had grown 13.1 percent, compared with post-recession gains of only 4.6 percent for the average recession from 1973 to 2000 and 7.2 percent for the average recession from 1947 to 2000.

The strength of U.S. productivity after 2001 puzzled many analysts of the business cycle.

The Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research, for example, pointed to the gap between output and employment growth in 2002 and early 2003 as a major problem in dating the end of the 2001 recession.

Explaining U.S.Productivity Growth We employ standard growth accounting techniques to decompose the growth of productivity into its components, or sources.Specifically, we quantify the proximate contributions of increased inputs of labor and capital services and other factors.
