<p>Tool use, whether using a stone, stick, rake, or pliers, provides an extension of the body (<xref rid="bib105" ref-type="bibr">Van Lawick-Goodall, 1970</xref>) and involves, among other things, the transfer of a proximal movement goal for the hand into a more distal goal for the tool (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Johnson and Grafton, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Arbib et al., 2009</xref>). A compelling demonstration that this transfer might actually occur at the cortical level comes from neural recordings of grasping neurons in the ventral premotor cortex (PMv) and motor cortex (M1) of macaque monkeys trained to use pliers (<xref rid="bib101" ref-type="bibr">Umilta et al., 2008</xref>). In both these areas, many neurons that encoded the specifics of hand grasping subsequently encoded tool grasping, even when use of the specific tool (reverse pliers that close as the hand grip opens) required hand kinematics opposite to those required when grasping with the hand alone. These findings suggest that tool use is supported by an effector-independent level of representation, in which the overall goal of the motor act is coded separately from the precise hand kinematics required to operate the tool. In further support of this notion, findings from human neuropsychology (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Berti and Frassinetti, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr">Maravita and Iriki, 2004</xref>), human behavior (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Gentilucci et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Cardinali et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), and macaque monkey neurophysiology (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Iriki et al., 1996</xref>) suggest that following training, a tool may actually become incorporated into the body schema of the actor and coded as an extension of the hand/limb. While provocative, how well does this single mechanism explain the neural substrates of tool use in humans, particularly within established networks that have been identified for tools (<xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Lewis, 2006</xref>), hand actions (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Culham et al., 2006</xref>), and body perception (<xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr">Peelen and Downing, 2007</xref>)?</p>
<p>Although considerable research has been done on the brain networks specialized for visual processing of tools and bodies and the visual-motor processing of hand actions, these topics have largely been studied in isolation. Increasing evidence from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) suggests that human frontoparietal and occipitotemporal cortex contain specialized regions that selectively represent tools and bodies (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Downing et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Lewis, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Frey, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr">Peelen and Downing, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">Peeters et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib102" ref-type="bibr">Valyear and Culham, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Bracci et al., 2012</xref>). For instance, when individuals view, imagine, or pantomime tool use actions, the supramarginal gyrus (SMG), posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG), and dorsal premotor cortex (PMd)—areas that have shown some of the greatest evolutionary expansion in humans (<xref rid="bib104" ref-type="bibr">Van Essen and Dierker, 2007</xref>)—are often co-activated (<xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Lewis, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Frey, 2007</xref>). fMRI studies further suggest that human occipitotemporal cortex also contains body-selective regions for perception, such as the extrastriate body area (EBA), which preferentially respond to viewing of the body and its parts (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Astafiev et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">David et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr">Peelen and Downing, 2007</xref>). The frontoparietal regions activated by tools are spatially close to (and perhaps overlapping with) brain areas implicated in hand actions, particularly the grip component of reach-to-grasp actions. Specifically, SMG lies very near the grasp-selective anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Chao and Martin, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib103" ref-type="bibr">Valyear et al., 2007</xref>) and PMd shows grasp-selective as well as tool-selective responses (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Grezes and Decety, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Gallivan et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, real hand actions activate other frontoparietal regions including the superior parieto-occipital cortex (SPOC) region, PMd, and additional areas along the IPS (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Culham et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Filimon, 2010</xref>), but the specific role of these areas in tool use remains unexplored. Moreover, almost all of the human neuroimaging studies of tools to date have used proxies for real tool use (reviewed in <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Lewis, 2006</xref>), including visual stimuli such as images or movies (e.g., <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Beauchamp et al., 2002</xref>), semantic tasks (e.g., <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">Martin et al., 1995</xref>), or simulated tool actions like pantomiming, imitating or imagining tool use (e.g., <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Johnson-Frey et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib94" ref-type="bibr">Rumiati et al., 2004</xref>) or making perceptual judgments about how one would use a tool (e.g., <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Jacobs et al., 2010</xref>). It remains unclear whether the highly specialized brain areas within these tool-, body-, and action-related networks in humans also play important roles in planning real movements with a tool or with the body (hand) alone.</p>
<p>The purpose of the current study was to examine exactly how and where in the human brain tool-specific, hand-specific, and effector-independent (shared hand and tool) representations are coded. To this aim we used fMRI to examine neural activity while human subjects performed a delayed-movement task that required grasp or reach actions towards a single target object. Critically, subjects performed these two different movements using either their hand or reverse tongs, which required opposite operating kinematics compared to when the hand was used alone. This manipulation allowed us to maintain a common set of actions throughout the experiment (grasping vs reaching) while at the same time varying the movement kinematics required to achieve those actions (i.e., depending on whether the hand vs tool effector was used). Using multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to decode preparatory (pre-movement) signals, we then probed exactly where in frontoparietal cortex and in tool- and body-selective areas in occipitotemporal cortex movement plans (grasping vs reaching) for the hand and tool were distinct (effector-specific) vs where signals related to upcoming actions of the hand could be used to predict the same actions performed with the tool (effector-independent).</p>
<p>Consistent with an effector-specific coding of hand- and tool-related movements we found that preparatory signals in SPOC and EBA differentiated upcoming movements of the hand only (i.e., hand-specific) whereas in SMG and pMTG they discriminated upcoming movements of the tool only (i.e., tool-specific). In addition, in anterior parietal regions (e.g., aIPS) and motor cortex we found that pre-movement activity patterns discriminated planned actions of ‘both’ the hand and tool but, importantly, could not be used to predict upcoming actions of the other effector. Instead, we found that this effector-independent type of coding was constrained to the preparatory signals of a subset of frontoparietal areas (posterior IPS and premotor cortex), suggesting that in these regions neural representations are more tightly linked to the goal of the action (grasping vs reaching) rather than the specific hand movements required to implement those goals.</p>
