Academy of Strategic Management Journal, Volume 12, Number 1, 2013 Kelly Monahan, Regent University ABSTRACT This study is an attempt to understand and clarify the moderating role of individual work values on the relationship between leader-member exchange (LMX) and work satisfaction within the American workforce. 
Data collected from a sample of 122 full-time working employees across various U.S. based organizations is assessed. 
A multiple regression analysis is used to determine the direct impact of leader-member exchange dimensions on extrinsic and intrinsic job satisfaction, and a hierarchical regression analysis is used to determine the moderating influence of self-enhancement and self-transcendence values. 
It is found that while LMX has a direct positive relationship with both facets of job satisfaction, LMX has a greater statistically significant influence on extrinsic facets of job satisfaction. 
The moderating analysis reveals that self-transcendence values significantly moderates the relationship between extrinsic work job satisfaction and LMX dimensions. 
These findings encourage managers to continue to develop the attributes of LMX, which in return will likely result in high employee extrinsic job satisfaction. 
The results also note the importance for managers to realize that they represent the organization for their employees, and their level of support and values is concurrent with how their employees view the entire organization. 
Keywords: Leader-member exchange, job satisfaction, work values INTRODUCTION The study of employee satisfaction and managerial influence continues to remain important in today’s volatile marketplace. 
Recently released data shows that U.S. job satisfaction is at an all-time low, with less than 50% of employees satisfied within their role (Consumer Research Center of The Conference Board, 2010). 
The literature notes that a contributing or detracting factor to one’s satisfaction is an employee’s direct supervisor (Robie, Ryan, Schmieder, Parra, & Smith, 1998). 
The social science field contains numerous studies expanding the literature regarding the relationship between work satisfaction and leadership. 
Specifically, research has found that leader-member exchange (LMX), which is the quality of Academy of Strategic Management Journal, Volume 12, Number 1, 2013 one’s relationship with his or her direct supervisor directly, influences ones satisfaction at work (eg. 
Graen, Novak & Sommerkamp, 1982; Graen, Orris & Johnson, 1973l; Scandura & Graen, 1984). 
However, a compelling influence to this relationship, which has largely been ignored within the literature are followers’ values. 
Human nature is comprised of innate values, which influence the way one is satisfied in their job (Schwartz, 1994). 
These values are the lens, which interprets ones relationship with his or her supervisor. 
Therefore, it is necessary for both employees as well as supervisors to understand the implications that followers’ values have on understanding the level of relationship with his or her supervisor and the impact it may have on their work satisfaction. 
However, few studies examine the impact that one’s values have on the relationship between leader-member exchange and work satisfaction. 
Callum’s (2011) study found a positive relationship between leader-member-exchange, job satisfaction and one’s psychological contract fulfillment. 
However, an employee’s psychological contract may vary from workplace to workplace depending upon the agreed expectations. 
Therefore, it is necessary to continue to explore ones values, which are fairly consistent throughout one’s life and not dependent upon a work environment (Schwartz, 1994). 
Graen et al. (1982) empirical research explored the relationship between an employee’s growth need strength and LMX. 
Moreover, while growth need strength may derive from ones values, this limited scope allows for little discussion surrounding the impact of an employee’s value set. 
Schyns, Kroon, and Moors (2008) note that few studies consider follower characteristics, such as values, within the LMX construct. 
Their study also measured the impact of followers’ growth need strength, extraversion, and locus of control. 
However, employees’ values are not discussed nor measured within the study. 
Questions remain such as, why are certain employees more satisfied with their supervisor and organization than others are? 
Why do certain employees’ relationships with the supervisor have greater influence on their job satisfaction compared to others? 
Ros, Schwartz and Surkiss (1999) point out the gap within the literature that exists concerning one’s values and its impact within the workplace in addressing questions such as these. 
This study is an attempt to understand and clarify the moderating role of individual work values on the relationship between leader-member exchange and work satisfaction within the American workforce. 
Though previous studies have noted that the quality of a leader’s relationship with an employee influences work satisfaction, few have examined the moderation effect of individual work values. 
Within the model, an employee’s work values are predicted to moderate the relationship between leader-member-exchange and employee work satisfaction. 
A quantitative study, using data collected from 122 participants further elaborates on the relationship between the influence of leader-member exchange on employee work satisfaction and the moderating role of work values. 
The research question under consideration is do individual work values moderate the relationship between leader-member exchange dimensions and employee work satisfaction. 
Academy of Strategic Management Journal, Volume 12, Number 1, 2013 A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE Leader-Member Exchange Theory Leader-member-exchange (LMX) theory is a relatively contemporary theory within leadership studies. 
Many leadership theories solely focus on the behaviors of the leader, rather than also noting the followers’ involvement. 
Dansereau, Graen, and Haga (1975) originated the construct when introducing the vertical dyad linkage (VDL) theory. 
VDL evolved into LMX theory with the emphasis on a leader’s relationship with each individual organizational member (Graen & Scandura, 1987). 
The central focus of the theory is understanding the relationship that exists between the supervisor and employee as well as the exchanges that take place over time between the two. 
How do individual relationships form between leader and employee, and how do they differ across organizational members? 
It has been suggested that these relationships form based on “personal compatibility and subordinate competence and dependability” (Yukl, 2006, p. 117). 
Dienesch and Linden (1986) argue that each behave based on the amount of resources one puts forth into the relationship. 
“For example, the leader may offer increased job latitude or delegation to the member, and the member may offer strong commitment to work goals or high levels of effort and performance to the leader” (Bauer & Green, 1996, p. 1538). 
However, a leader has only a limited amount of resources to dispense upon individual followers. 
Therefore, Green, Anderson, and Shivers (1996) note the disparity between what is considered high-level exchanges and lower-level exchanges. 
For example, those relationships between leader and follower that exhibit mutual respect and trust will evolve into higher quality relationships. 
Whereas, those that evolve based on obligation of organizational employment will experience a lower quality relationship (Liden, Sparrowe & Wayne, 1997). 
Since the origination of LMX theory, a growing body of research has been conducted to determine the outcomes of LMX theory. 
Many of the studies confirm that a follower’s relationship with the leader is crucial to one’s work experience (Graen & Cashman, 1975; Graen & Uhl-Bien, 1995). 
One of the noteworthy outcomes supported in the literature is that leadermember exchange is related to subordinate satisfaction (Graen, Novak & Sommerkamp, 1982; Graen, Orris & Johnson, 1973l; Scandura & Graen, 1984). 
Liden and Maslyn’s studies (1998) also have found a significant correlation between LMX and job satisfaction. 
In addition, few studies exist surrounding the influence that LMX has on the different factors of job satisfaction, intrinsic and extrinsic. 
Springer (2006) explored the relationship of overall LMX and its varying influence on either extrinsic or intrinsic job satisfaction. 
Two questions under consideration are does LMX dimensions positively correlate with job satisfaction and do these factors of LMX differ on their impact between extrinsic and intrinsic motivators of job satisfaction. 
Academy of Strategic Management Journal, Volume 12, Number 1, 2013 Individual Job Satisfaction Locke et al. (2001) describes job satisfaction as the gratifying state one experiences while on the job. 
Fields (2002) defines job satisfaction, “as an employee’s affective reactions to a job based on comparing actual outcomes with desired outcomes” (p. 1). Westover et al (2010) note that when expectations are met or exceeded, employee job satisfaction is often high. 
Work satisfaction is known to not only impact one’s work life, but also one’s personal life as well (Judge & Watanable, 1993). 
“Job satisfaction has larger effects on life satisfaction, suggesting that job satisfaction is an essential component of an employee’s life” (Fields, 2002, p. 2). Also noted is that employees who are more satisfied in their role are more likely to outperform those who are not (Ostroff, 1992). 
Therefore, it is important to understand the impact of employee satisfaction within the workplace, and the role leader-member-exchange plays in influencing it. Employee work satisfaction stems from a variety of factors, such as the comparison of anticipated outcomes with definite consequences (Cranny, Smith, & Stone, 1992), internal and external job components (Howard & Frank, 1996), job performance (George & Jones, 1997), as well as values (Kinicki & Kreitner, 2007). 
The literature also provides a connection between management and work satisfaction (Robie, Ryan, Schmieder, Parra, & Smith, 1998). 
Herzberg (1966) found a link between employee’ work dissatisfaction and their immediate supervisor. 
Also worth nothing is that Zeitz (1990) found an employee’s perception of management helped explain job satisfaction. 
While numerous studies in the literature support the relationship between LMX and job satisfaction, few have explored the difference in follower experience of LMX between intrinsic and extrinsic job satisfaction. 
Questions remain such as does a followers perception of LMX have greater influence on the employee’s extrinsic or intrinsic job satisfaction? 
Therefore, the proposed model suggests that leader-member exchange will be positively relate to both intrinsic and extrinsic job satisfaction, but have a greater influence on an employee’s extrinsic job satisfaction. 
The rationale behind the greater influence on extrinsic job satisfaction is the manager’s ability to influence those facets of an employee’s job. 
Table 1: Facets of Job Satisfaction Intrinsic Factors Extrinsic Factors Interest in job Compensation Meaningful work Benefits Status Relationships Personal growth Opportunities Sense of accomplishment Respect Sense of fulfillment Recognition Autonomy Academy of Strategic Management Journal, Volume 12, Number 1, 2013 Table 1 notes the facets of job satisfaction of both extrinsic as well as intrinsic job satisfaction. 
The model also proposes the following control variables should also be considered based on their potential influence on job satisfaction: a) an employee’s compensation, b) gender, c) age, and d) education level, as these have found to have an influence on employee work satisfaction as well (Fields, 2002). 
H1a: Followers’ experience with leader-member exchange are positively related to overall employee work satisfaction H1b: Followers’ experience with leader-member exchange is more positively related to extrinsic job satisfaction than intrinsic job satisfaction Individual Work Values While the literature is full of studies examining leader-member exchange and its outcomes, there are few if not any that examine the moderating influence of an employee’s individual work values. 
Basic values are often explained as one’s beliefs, needs, goals, and preferences (Fields, 2002). 
Work values are those basic values expressed in a work setting (Ros et al., 1999). 
These work values represent what an employee is seeking for in their general work experience. 
Therefore, work values will generally influence the way the employee views the role of his or her manager. 
Harding, Phillips, and Fogarty’s (1986) work confirm the role values play in the personal development of employees and the way it affects the employee’s outlook. 
For example, an employee who values work relationships will expect a high quality exchange with their manager. 
If on the other hand an employee values power over the relationship with one’s supervisor, the quality of the exchange with one’s manager will lessen in its ability to influence the employee’s satisfaction. 
The proposed model will focus on Schwartz’s (1994) theory of basic human values, in which the researcher identifies ten specific motivational values, which are universally recognized. 
The ten motivational values are power, achievement, hedonism, stimulation, selfdirection, universalism, benevolence, tradition, conformity, and security. 
Overarching these ten motivational values are four core values: openness to change, conservation, self-enhancement, and self-transcendence. 
Table 2 summarizes the various motivational values, which fall under each category. 
For this, particular study, self-enhancement and self-transcendence values are chosen for measurement by using an abbreviated version of Schwartz (1994) Work Values Survey. 
The literature supports that two core components, for example self-transcendence and conservation, “share a single motivational goal—subordination on self in favor of socially imposed expectations” (Ros et al., 1999, p. 52). 
Therefore, the focus on self-enhancement and selftranscendence will simplify the study while ensuring that all motivational goals are being measured. 
Academy of Strategic Management Journal, Volume 12, Number 1, 2013 Table 2: Schwartz (1994) Individual Values Openness to Change Conservation Self-Enhancement Self-Transcendence Hedonism Security Achievement Universalism Stimulation Tradition Power Benevolence Self-Direction Conformity Hedonism Self-enhancement values focus on dominance over others for the benefit of oneself. 
On the other end of the spectrum of values is self-transcendence, which emphasizes tolerance and viewing all as equals, and therefore expressing concern for the general welfare (Elenkov, Naoumova, Lowery, Chornovil, Sarov, & Andov, 2004). 
These opposing value sets are proposed to influence the relationship between leader-member exchange and employee work satisfaction due to the change in expectations of one’s dyad relationship, depending on an individual’s value set, thereby strengthening or weakening this relationship. 
The level of one’s exchange and its ability to influence one’s satisfaction at work is proposed to strengthen for those individuals that hold self-transcendence values. 
Whereas those individuals who hold selfenhancement values, it is proposed that, the relationship with one’s manager and its influence on one’s satisfaction is weakened. 
Figure 1. The proposed model suggests that leader-member exchange will be positively related to employee work satisfaction, with a moderating influence of an employee’s individual work values. 
For example, an employee who values benevolence will more likely be satisfied when he or she experiences a high quality relationship with one’s direct supervisor, because that employee believes the supervisor is directly involved with the employee and organization’s Leader-Member Exchange S elf-t ranscendence values (Mo) Self-enhancement values (Mo) Employee Intrinsic Job Satisfaction Employee Extrinsic Job Satisfaction H1H3 H2 Academy of Strategic Management Journal, Volume 12, Number 1, 2013 welfare. 
However, if the employee values his or her own power and advancement, than the level of ones relationship with the manager is not as important to his or her satisfaction. 
H2: Self-enhancement values of employees will weaken the relationship between leadermember exchange and employee work satisfaction H3: Self-transcendence values of employees will strengthen the relationship between leader-member exchange and employee work satisfaction METHODOLOGY Sample and Procedures The participants were collected from a convenience sample and asked to complete an online questionnaire. 
Questionnaires were distributed over a four-week period using social media networks and email. 
The sampling method chosen was the snowball method of data collection. 
Participants were sent a link to the questionnaire and asked to pass along to other participants who may be interested in completing. 
The researcher noted within the message that participants must be currently working full-time and have a direct supervisor. 
A total of 122 questionnaires were returned and determined to be usable questionnaires. 
Therefore, the sample consists of 122 followers within a variety of US based organizations. 
The sample consists of 57% females and 43% males. 
The sample consists of 49% within the 35-54 age range, while 31% fell into the 26-34 age range. 
Forty-one percent of the sample hold a bachelor’s degree, (15% had high school degree or some college), 41% obtained a master’s degree and 5% completed doctoral work. 
41% of the sample brings home more than $90,000 in annual compensation. 
MEASUREMENTS Leader-Member Exchange. 
To measure the dimensions of leader-member exchange, the LMX-MDM instrument originated by Liden and Maslyn (1998) is used. 
The measure is comprised of 12 questions within the instrument. 
The items are scored from 1 to 5, ranging from 1 = strongly disagree to 5=strongly agree. 
Sample items include, “My supervisor is the kind of person one would like to have as a friend”, “I am impressed with my supervisor’s knowledge of his/her job”, “My supervisor defends my work actions to a superior, even without complete knowledge of the issue in question”, and “I do work for my supervisor that goes beyond what is specified in my job Academy of Strategic Management Journal, Volume 12, Number 1, 2013 descriptions”. 
The 12-item scale’s was α= .920 for this sample. 
While the instrument can measure four identified dimensions within the LMX construct (professional respect, contribution, loyalty, and affect), Graen and Uhl-Bien (1995) note that, “LMX construct has multiple dimensions, but these dimensions are so highly correlated that they can be tapped into with the single measure of LMX” (p. 237). 
Therefore, due to the high level of inter-correlations among the dimensions within the instrument, the overall construct of LMX, which measures the quality of one’s exchange with a direct supervisor, will be used throughout the analysis and results, rather than analyzing four individual highly correlated dimensions. 
Job Satisfaction. 
To measure job satisfaction the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ) short form, consisting of 20 questions is used. 
These questions provide a wide range of general job satisfaction measures. 
A 5-point Likert scale captures the responses ranging from 1= very dissatisfied with this aspect of my job to 5= very satisfied with this aspect of my job. 
Sample items include “The chance to work alone on the job”, “The way my job provides for steady employment”, and “The working conditions”. 
Fields (2002) reports that the reliability for the short form questionnaire has ranged with a coefficient alpha from .85 to .91 in previous studies (eg. 
Hart, 1999; Huber, Seybolt, & Venemon, 1992; Klenke-Hamel & Mathieu, 1990). 
Also noted is the test-retest reliability of r=.58 across three periods (Wong et al., 1998). 
The scale also contains two subsets of job satisfaction, which are intrinsic factors (12 questions, α=.856) and extrinsic items (8 questions, α=.799), both proving high reliability upon the subsets of the instrument. 
Individual Work Values. 
A modified version of Schwartz (1994) Work Value Survey is used to measure individual work values. 
The self-transcended values subset contains 18 items with α=.899. 
Self-enhanced values consists of 13 questions with α=.770. 
A 5-point likert scale is used ranging from 1= opposed to my values to 5= of supreme importance. 
Sample items include “Protecting the environment” (universalism), “Helpful” (benevolence), “Social power” (power), “successful” (achievement), and “enjoying life” (hedonism). 
RESULTS The zero-order correlations for LMX and the two factors of job satisfaction are reported in Table 3. As displayed in the table, LMX dimensions are positively related to job satisfaction; however, LMX dimensions are more strongly correlated to extrinsic job satisfaction factors Academy of Strategic Management Journal, Volume 12, Number 1, 2013 (.577) compared to intrinsic (.400). 
All correlations are statistical significant at the p < 0.01 level.

*. Correlation is significant at the 0.05 level (2-tailed). 
Two multiple hierarchical moderated regression analyses were completed to test the main effect and the interaction hypotheses (see Table 4 & 5). To test each of the moderation effects, the control variables were entered into the first block (age, gender, income, and education), followed by the main effects of overall LMX and values, and the interaction in the last box. 
This method is consistent with the procedures described by Aiken and West (1991). 
Hypothesis 1a predicted that LMX would be positively related to overall job satisfaction. 
As seen in Table 4, LMX are positively related to job satisfaction (β=.505, p<0.01), demonstrating incremental validity (∆R2 =.243) beyond the control variables. 
Overall, these findings are consistent with hypothesis 1a, which suggest that the level of one’s relationship as seen in LMX theory is directly associated with the level of one’s satisfaction at work. 
Hypothesis 1b predicted that LMX will be more positively associated with extrinsic compared to intrinsic job satisfaction. 
As seen in the zero-order correlations, while both facets of job satisfaction are positively related to LMX, LMX are significantly higher with extrinsic job satisfaction compared to intrinsic (z=1.730, p<0.05). 
Results from the regression analysis also support this conclusion that LMX’s influence on extrinsic job satisfaction (β=.560, p<0.01) is greater compared to intrinsic (β=.378, p<0.01) while controlling for all control variables (age, gender, income, and education). 
These results are statistically significant when testing for the difference in the regression coefficients (z=1.99, p<.05). 
Therefore, hypothesis 1b is fully supported by these findings.

After running a hierarchical regression analysis of the interaction of LMX*self-enhancement values, it did not yield a significant interaction beyond the main effects on both extrinsic job satisfaction (β=0.64, p>.05, ∆R 2 = 0) and intrinsic job satisfaction (β=-.179, p>.05, ∆R 2 = 0). Therefore, hypothesis 2 is not supported.

A moderated hierarchical regression analysis was performed, yielding a statically significant interaction on extrinsic job satisfaction (β=.274, p<.10, ∆R 2 = 0.02) as seen in Table 8. While a change is also record on intrinsic work satisfaction as seen in Table 7, it was not deemed statistically significant (β=.077 p>.10, ∆R 2 = 0.005). 
Therefore, hypothesis 3 is supported when examining the Academy of Strategic Management Journal, Volume 12, Number 1, 2013 interaction on extrinsic work satisfaction, however not supported when noting the interaction on intrinsic work satisfaction.

To explore further the statistically significant interaction, the method described by Aiken and West (1991), which examines the effect of LMX at high and low levels of self-transcendence values was chosen. 
The process also involves that all variables are mean-centered to control for multicollinearity before entering into the regression analysis. 
A standard deviation of 1 above the 2 3 4 Low LMX High LMX Extrinsic Job Satisfaction Low ST Values High ST Values Academy of Strategic Management Journal, Volume 12, Number 1, 2013 mean was chosen to represent the high level of values and 1 standard deviation below the mean to represent low level of values. 
The impact of the interaction is visually shown in Figure 2. As hypothesized, those employees who perceived a high-level exchange with their supervisor were more likely to be extrinsically satisfied in their employment when espoused with selftranscendence values. 
DISCUSSION This study adds to the theoretical framework in at least two specific regards. 
The first is the finding that while LMX has a positive impact on overall job satisfaction, there is a greater significant influence on extrinsic facets of job satisfaction compared to intrinsic. 
The positive influence of LMX on overall job satisfaction is consistent with existing LMX Theory, which focuses on the level of exchange between employee and supervisor, (Graen, 1995) leading to a significant impact on employee work satisfaction. 
Specifically, LMX dimensions, which note a high-quality exchange, are directly positively associated with both extrinsic as well as intrinsic job satisfaction factors, consistent with the findings in previous studies (eg. 
Graen 1982; Stringer, 2006). 
As Stringer (2006) notes, “When employees have a high quality relationship with their supervisor they get to enjoy the benefits of favors such as mutual trust, support from their supervisor, effective communication, consideration, and esteem, and consequently, they more likely will be satisfied with their job, accomplish more, and help the organization prosper” (p. 136). 
While many historical studies have found LMX to positively influence overall job satisfaction, few have focused on determining what specific facets of job satisfaction are most impacted. 
The findings of the study are consistent with Herzberg’s (1959) theory of job satisfaction, which states that extrinsic needs are influenced by supervision and relationships, whereas intrinsic needs are fulfilled by advancement, achievement and increased responsibility. 
It appears that as the level of exchange between supervisor and employee increases, the likelihood of extrinsic needs being fulfilled also increases. 
Therefore, the higher the exchange the greater opportunities the manager has in removing extrinsic barriers to an employee’s satisfaction. 
Noted within the literature is the effect, not only a high quality exchange has, but also a low quality relationship on extrinsic job satisfaction. 
Memmi (1974) and Noddings (1984) found that employees with low quality relationships with their supervisor felt nonchalantly supported by the organization. 
Khan (1998) notes that when this occurs an employee’s trust in the supervisor and organization decreases, and therefore only shares information relevant to complete the job. 
Problems arise such as burnout, alienation, and ultimately employees leaving the organization. 
Therefore, it is of the upmost importance that managers continue to develop the attributes of affect, loyalty, contribution and professional respect, which in return will likely result in high employee extrinsic job satisfaction. 
Academy of Strategic Management Journal, Volume 12, Number 1, 2013 The second contribution of this study to the literature is the finding of the moderating influence of self-transcendence values on the relationship between LMX and extrinsic job satisfaction. 
Results from the study indicate that the relationship between LMX and extrinsic job satisfaction is more strongly related when an employee values relationships and the welfare of the organization, which is consistent with Schwartz’s (1996) work values theory on selftranscendence values. 
Furthermore, to the researcher’s knowledge, there are no existing studies, which examine the link of one’s individual work values on the interpretation of LMX and job satisfaction. 
The supervisor is seen as an extension of the organization, and when the level of relationship is low, the employee’s relationship with the organization is more likely to be disengaged (Memmi, 1974). 
Therefore, it is important for managers to realize that they represent the organization for their employees, and their level of support and values is concurrent with how their employees view the entire organization. 
While it was found that self-transcendence values moderate the influence of LMX on extrinsic job satisfaction, it is worthy to note that self-transcendence values is not directly associated with LMX (r = 0.05). 
This finding suggests that LMX’s direct impact on job satisfaction is largely through its dimensions (affect, contribution, loyalty and professional respect) rather than the leader’s concern for the general welfare of the organization. 
This purpose of this study was to understand and clarify the moderating role of individual work values on the relationship between leader-member exchange and work satisfaction within the American workforce. 
The question was posed, what do values have to do with it? 
In summary, values have much to do with the relationship between leadership and employee job satisfaction, specifically as it relates to LMX and extrinsic job factors. 
The findings reveal two important contributions to the literature including LMX’s greater influence on extrinsic job satisfaction and the moderating role of self-transcendence values. 
This implies that the role of the supervisor in representing the organization is amplified for those employees who possess self-transcendence values. 
Therefore, supervisors must be cognizant of their level of exchange with employees and its ultimate impact on both the employee and organization. 
LIMITATIONS It is important to understand the results with the perspective of potential limitations of the study. 
There are at least three limitations identified. 
The first limitation deals with the nature of a cross-sectional study design, which does not allow for claims regarding the causality of LMX, work values and job satisfaction. 
Therefore, there is a need for a well-designed longitudinal study, which could further explain the complexity of the relationships examined and potentially make causal inferences. 
The second limitation is the fact that the questionnaire design can also lead to the halo effect and common method variances. 
The researcher cannot exclude to mention that the evaluation of one’s supervisor will cause the respondent to evaluate all aspects in a similar manner. 
Podsakoff et al (2009) suggest procedural and statistical measures to be taken to Academy of Strategic Management Journal, Volume 12, Number 1, 2013 protect against common method variance, such as ordering the questions within the survey in a diverse manner, which the researcher has done. 
The third limitation of the study results from the data collection method chosen, which was a convenience sample. 
Due to the time and resource constraints of the researcher, in order to collect as many sample cases as possible, the snowball method was encouraged to attract more participants. 
Therefore, the results of the study may be limited in their generalizability. 
Regarding the sample, it is also important to note that the sample tends to skew towards higher income (>40% of the participants make $90,000+) and well-educated individuals (>50% of the participants hold a bachelors degree or higher). 
Therefore, it is strongly encouraged for future research to measure the moderating influence of values against a larger and more diverse sample size to allow for greater generalizability. 
CONCLUSIONS This is one of the first studies to examine the moderating effect of an employee’s individual work values on the relationship between the perception of LMX and job satisfaction. 
The findings reveal that employees extend their perception of the organization onto their direct leader, and therefore those whom hold self-transcendence values, will look for the supervisor for greater exchanges and support as they see them as an extension of the values of the organization. 
The purpose of the study was to determine if values moderate LMX and job satisfaction, and while the results support that self-transcendence values moderate the relationship of LMX and extrinsic job satisfaction, there is an appeal for the study to be completed in a larger and more diverse sample to allow for greater generalizability of the conclusions drawn.
