The research question under consideration is do individual work values moderate the relationship between leader-member exchange dimensions and employee work satisfaction.

Therefore, it is important to understand the impact of employee satisfaction within the workplace, and the role leader-member-exchange plays in influencing it.

On the other end of the spectrum of values is self-transcendence, which emphasizes tolerance and viewing all as equals, and therefore expressing concern for the general welfare (Elenkov, Naoumova, Lowery, Chornovil, Sarov, & Andov, 2004).

While the instrument can measure four identified dimensions within the LMX construct (professional respect, contribution, loyalty, and affect), Graen and Uhl-Bien (1995) note that, “LMX construct has multiple dimensions, but these dimensions are so highly correlated that they can be tapped into with the single measure of LMX” (p. 237).

RESULTS The zero-order correlations for LMX and the two factors of job satisfaction are reported in Table 3. As displayed in the table, LMX dimensions are positively related to job satisfaction; however, LMX dimensions are more strongly correlated to extrinsic job satisfaction factors Academy of Strategic Management Journal, Volume 12, Number 1, 2013 (.577) compared to intrinsic (.400).

Therefore, hypothesis 3 is supported when examining the Academy of Strategic Management Journal, Volume 12, Number 1, 2013 interaction on extrinsic work satisfaction, however not supported when noting the interaction on intrinsic work satisfaction.

Therefore, it is of the upmost importance that managers continue to develop the attributes of affect, loyalty, contribution and professional respect, which in return will likely result in high employee extrinsic job satisfaction.

Academy of Strategic Management Journal, Volume 12, Number 1, 2013 The second contribution of this study to the literature is the finding of the moderating influence of self-transcendence values on the relationship between LMX and extrinsic job satisfaction.

This finding suggests that LMX’s direct impact on job satisfaction is largely through its dimensions (affect, contribution, loyalty and professional respect) rather than the leader’s concern for the general welfare of the organization.

The findings reveal two important contributions to the literature including LMX’s greater influence on extrinsic job satisfaction and the moderating role of self-transcendence values.

LIMITATIONS It is important to understand the results with the perspective of potential limitations of the study.

There are at least three limitations identified.

The first limitation deals with the nature of a cross-sectional study design, which does not allow for claims regarding the causality of LMX, work values and job satisfaction.

Therefore, there is a need for a well-designed longitudinal study, which could further explain the complexity of the relationships examined and potentially make causal inferences.

The second limitation is the fact that the questionnaire design can also lead to the halo effect and common method variances.

The third limitation of the study results from the data collection method chosen, which was a convenience sample.

Therefore, the results of the study may be limited in their generalizability.

Therefore, it is strongly encouraged for future research to measure the moderating influence of values against a larger and more diverse sample size to allow for greater generalizability.
