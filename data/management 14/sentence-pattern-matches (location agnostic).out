While the instrument can measure four identified dimensions within the LMX construct (professional respect, contribution, loyalty, and affect), Graen and Uhl-Bien (1995) note that, “LMX construct has multiple dimensions, but these dimensions are so highly correlated that they can be tapped into with the single measure of LMX” (p. 237).'

RESULTS The zero-order correlations for LMX and the two factors of job satisfaction are reported in Table 3. As displayed in the table, LMX dimensions are positively related to job satisfaction; however, LMX dimensions are more strongly correlated to extrinsic job satisfaction factors Academy of Strategic Management Journal, Volume 12, Number 1, 2013 (.577) compared to intrinsic (.400).'
