Data collected from a sample of 122 full-time working employees across various U.S.
Map(start -> 30, end -> 31, match -> of)


A multiple regression analysis is used to determine the direct impact of leader-member exchange dimensions on extrinsic and intrinsic job satisfaction, and a hierarchical regression analysis is used to determine the moderating influence of self-enhancement and self-transcendence values.

It is found that while LMX has a direct positive relationship with both facets of job satisfaction, LMX has a greater statistically significant influence on extrinsic facets of job satisfaction.

Map(start -> 105, end -> 107, match -> has)
Map(start -> 175, end -> 176, match -> of)


The moderating analysis reveals that self-transcendence values significantly moderates the relationship between extrinsic work job satisfaction and LMX dimensions.
Map(start -> 88, end -> 90, match -> the)


These findings encourage managers to continue to develop the attributes of LMX, which in return will likely result in high employee extrinsic job satisfaction.

The results also note the importance for managers to realize that they represent the organization for their employees, and their level of support and values is concurrent with how their employees view the entire organization.

Keywords: Leader-member exchange, job satisfaction, work values INTRODUCTION The study of employee satisfaction and managerial influence continues to remain important in today’s volatile marketplace.
Map(start -> 88, end -> 89, match -> of)

job satisfaction is at an all-time low, with less than 50% of employees satisfied within their role (Consumer Research Center of The Conference Board, 2010).
Map(start -> 50, end -> 53, match -> than)
Map(start -> 59, end -> 60, match -> of)
Map(start -> 126, end -> 127, match -> of)


The social science field contains numerous studies expanding the literature regarding the relationship between work satisfaction and leadership.
Map(start -> 62, end -> 64, match -> the)
Map(start -> 87, end -> 89, match -> the)


Specifically, research has found that leader-member exchange (LMX), which is the quality of Academy of Strategic Management Journal, Volume 12, Number 1, 2013 one’s relationship with his or her direct supervisor directly, influences ones satisfaction at work (eg.
Map(start -> 15, end -> 22, match -> research)
Map(start -> 24, end -> 26, match -> has)
Map(start -> 67, end -> 67, match -> ,)
Map(start -> 78, end -> 80, match -> the)
Map(start -> 90, end -> 91, match -> of)
Map(start -> 101, end -> 102, match -> of)
Map(start -> 143, end -> 143, match -> ,)
Map(start -> 153, end -> 153, match -> ,)


However, a compelling influence to this relationship, which has largely been ignored within the literature are followers’ values.
Map(start -> 36, end -> 39, match -> this)
Map(start -> 61, end -> 63, match -> has)
Map(start -> 93, end -> 95, match -> the)


Human nature is comprised of innate values, which influence the way one is satisfied in their job (Schwartz, 1994).
Map(start -> 27, end -> 28, match -> of)
Map(start -> 61, end -> 63, match -> the)


These values are the lens, which interprets ones relationship with his or her supervisor.
Map(start -> 18, end -> 20, match -> the)


Therefore, it is necessary for both employees as well as supervisors to understand the implications that followers’ values have on understanding the level of relationship with his or her supervisor and the impact it may have on their work satisfaction.
Map(start -> 28, end -> 30, match -> for)
Map(start -> 73, end -> 82, match -> understand)

Map(start -> 203, end -> 205, match -> the)
Map(start -> 221, end -> 224, match -> have)


However, few studies examine the impact that one’s values have on the relationship between leader-member exchange and work satisfaction.
Map(start -> 30, end -> 32, match -> the)
Map(start -> 59, end -> 62, match -> have)
Map(start -> 67, end -> 69, match -> the)


However, an employee’s psychological contract may vary from workplace to workplace depending upon the agreed expectations.
Map(start -> 99, end -> 101, match -> the)


Therefore, it is necessary to continue to explore ones values, which are fairly consistent throughout one’s life and not dependent upon a work environment (Schwartz, 1994).

Map(start -> 18, end -> 29, match -> necessary to)
Map(start -> 40, end -> 49, match -> to explore)
Map(start -> 118, end -> 120, match -> not)

(1982) empirical research explored the relationship between an employee’s growth need strength and LMX.
Map(start -> 17, end -> 24, match -> research)
Map(start -> 35, end -> 37, match -> the)


Moreover, while growth need strength may derive from ones values, this limited scope allows for little discussion surrounding the impact of an employee’s value set.
Map(start -> 67, end -> 70, match -> this)
Map(start -> 93, end -> 95, match -> for)
Map(start -> 97, end -> 102, match -> little)
Map(start -> 127, end -> 129, match -> the)
Map(start -> 138, end -> 139, match -> of)


Schyns, Kroon, and Moors (2008) note that few studies consider follower characteristics, such as values, within the LMX construct.
Map(start -> 113, end -> 115, match -> the)


Their study also measured the impact of followers’ growth need strength, extraversion, and locus of control.
Map(start -> 27, end -> 29, match -> the)
Map(start -> 38, end -> 39, match -> of)
Map(start -> 98, end -> 99, match -> of)


However, employees’ values are not discussed nor measured within the study.
Map(start -> 32, end -> 34, match -> not)
Map(start -> 66, end -> 68, match -> the)


Questions remain such as, why are certain employees more satisfied with their supervisor and organization than others are?
Map(start -> 107, end -> 110, match -> than)


Why do certain employees’ relationships with the supervisor have greater influence on their job satisfaction compared to others?
Map(start -> 46, end -> 48, match -> the)
Map(start -> 61, end -> 64, match -> have)


Ros, Schwartz and Surkiss (1999) point out the gap within the literature that exists concerning one’s values and its impact within the workplace in addressing questions such as these.

This study is an attempt to understand and clarify the moderating role of individual work values on the relationship between leader-member exchange and work satisfaction within the American workforce.
Map(start -> 29, end -> 38, match -> understand)
Map(start -> 52, end -> 54, match -> the)
Map(start -> 72, end -> 73, match -> of)
Map(start -> 101, end -> 103, match -> the)
Map(start -> 178, end -> 180, match -> the)


Though previous studies have noted that the quality of a leader’s relationship with an employee influences work satisfaction, few have examined the moderation effect of individual work values.
Map(start -> 25, end -> 28, match -> have)
Map(start -> 41, end -> 43, match -> the)
Map(start -> 53, end -> 54, match -> of)

Map(start -> 145, end -> 147, match -> the)
Map(start -> 167, end -> 168, match -> of)


Within the model, an employee’s work values are predicted to moderate the relationship between leader-member-exchange and employee work satisfaction.
Map(start -> 8, end -> 10, match -> the)
Map(start -> 71, end -> 73, match -> the)


A quantitative study, using data collected from 122 participants further elaborates on the relationship between the influence of leader-member exchange on employee work satisfaction and the moderating role of work values.
Map(start -> 88, end -> 90, match -> the)
Map(start -> 113, end -> 115, match -> the)

Map(start -> 187, end -> 189, match -> the)
Map(start -> 207, end -> 208, match -> of)


The research question under consideration is do individual work values moderate the relationship between leader-member exchange dimensions and employee work satisfaction.
