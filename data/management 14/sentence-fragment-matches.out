Data collected from a sample of 122 full-time working employees across various U.S. based organizations is assessed.
Map(start -> 30, end -> 31, match -> of)


A multiple regression analysis is used to determine the direct impact of leader-member exchange dimensions on extrinsic and intrinsic job satisfaction, and a hierarchical regression analysis is used to determine the moderating influence of self-enhancement and self-transcendence values.

It is found that while LMX has a direct positive relationship with both facets of job satisfaction, LMX has a greater statistically significant influence on extrinsic facets of job satisfaction.

Map(start -> 105, end -> 107, match -> has)

The moderating analysis reveals that self-transcendence values significantly moderates the relationship between extrinsic work job satisfaction and LMX dimensions.
Map(start -> 88, end -> 90, match -> the)


These findings encourage managers to continue to develop the attributes of LMX, which in return will likely result in high employee extrinsic job satisfaction.

The results also note the importance for managers to realize that they represent the organization for their employees, and their level of support and values is concurrent with how their employees view the entire organization.

Keywords: Leader-member exchange, job satisfaction, work values INTRODUCTION The study of employee satisfaction and managerial influence continues to remain important in today’s volatile marketplace.
Map(start -> 88, end -> 89, match -> of)

job satisfaction is at an all-time low, with less than 50% of employees satisfied within their role (Consumer Research Center of The Conference Board, 2010).
Map(start -> 50, end -> 53, match -> than)
Map(start -> 59, end -> 60, match -> of)
Map(start -> 126, end -> 127, match -> of)


The social science field contains numerous studies expanding the literature regarding the relationship between work satisfaction and leadership.
Map(start -> 62, end -> 64, match -> the)
Map(start -> 87, end -> 89, match -> the)


Specifically, research has found that leader-member exchange (LMX), which is the quality of Academy of Strategic Management Journal, Volume 12, Number 1, 2013 one’s relationship with his or her direct supervisor directly, influences ones satisfaction at work (eg.
Map(start -> 15, end -> 22, match -> research)
Map(start -> 24, end -> 26, match -> has)
Map(start -> 67, end -> 67, match -> ,)
Map(start -> 78, end -> 80, match -> the)
Map(start -> 90, end -> 91, match -> of)
Map(start -> 101, end -> 102, match -> of)
Map(start -> 143, end -> 143, match -> ,)
Map(start -> 153, end -> 153, match -> ,)


However, a compelling influence to this relationship, which has largely been ignored within the literature are followers’ values.
Map(start -> 36, end -> 39, match -> this)
Map(start -> 61, end -> 63, match -> has)
Map(start -> 93, end -> 95, match -> the)


Human nature is comprised of innate values, which influence the way one is satisfied in their job (Schwartz, 1994).
Map(start -> 27, end -> 28, match -> of)
Map(start -> 61, end -> 63, match -> the)


These values are the lens, which interprets ones relationship with his or her supervisor.
Map(start -> 18, end -> 20, match -> the)


Therefore, it is necessary for both employees as well as supervisors to understand the implications that followers’ values have on understanding the level of relationship with his or her supervisor and the impact it may have on their work satisfaction.
Map(start -> 28, end -> 30, match -> for)
Map(start -> 73, end -> 82, match -> understand)
Map(start -> 84, end -> 86, match -> the)

Map(start -> 203, end -> 205, match -> the)
Map(start -> 221, end -> 224, match -> have)


However, few studies examine the impact that one’s values have on the relationship between leader-member exchange and work satisfaction.
Map(start -> 30, end -> 32, match -> the)
Map(start -> 59, end -> 62, match -> have)
Map(start -> 67, end -> 69, match -> the)


However, an employee’s psychological contract may vary from workplace to workplace depending upon the agreed expectations.
Map(start -> 99, end -> 101, match -> the)


Therefore, it is necessary to continue to explore ones values, which are fairly consistent throughout one’s life and not dependent upon a work environment (Schwartz, 1994).

Map(start -> 118, end -> 120, match -> not)

(1982) empirical research explored the relationship between an employee’s growth need strength and LMX.
Map(start -> 17, end -> 24, match -> research)
Map(start -> 35, end -> 37, match -> the)


Moreover, while growth need strength may derive from ones values, this limited scope allows for little discussion surrounding the impact of an employee’s value set.
Map(start -> 67, end -> 70, match -> this)
Map(start -> 93, end -> 95, match -> for)
Map(start -> 97, end -> 102, match -> little)
Map(start -> 127, end -> 129, match -> the)
Map(start -> 138, end -> 139, match -> of)


Schyns, Kroon, and Moors (2008) note that few studies consider follower characteristics, such as values, within the LMX construct.
Map(start -> 113, end -> 115, match -> the)


Their study also measured the impact of followers’ growth need strength, extraversion, and locus of control.
Map(start -> 27, end -> 29, match -> the)
Map(start -> 38, end -> 39, match -> of)
Map(start -> 98, end -> 99, match -> of)


However, employees’ values are not discussed nor measured within the study.
Map(start -> 32, end -> 34, match -> not)
Map(start -> 66, end -> 68, match -> the)


Questions remain such as, why are certain employees more satisfied with their supervisor and organization than others are?
Map(start -> 107, end -> 110, match -> than)


Why do certain employees’ relationships with the supervisor have greater influence on their job satisfaction compared to others?
Map(start -> 46, end -> 48, match -> the)
Map(start -> 61, end -> 64, match -> have)


Ros, Schwartz and Surkiss (1999) point out the gap within the literature that exists concerning one’s values and its impact within the workplace in addressing questions such as these.

This study is an attempt to understand and clarify the moderating role of individual work values on the relationship between leader-member exchange and work satisfaction within the American workforce.

Though previous studies have noted that the quality of a leader’s relationship with an employee influences work satisfaction, few have examined the moderation effect of individual work values.

Map(start -> 145, end -> 147, match -> the)
Map(start -> 167, end -> 168, match -> of)


Within the model, an employee’s work values are predicted to moderate the relationship between leader-member-exchange and employee work satisfaction.
Map(start -> 8, end -> 10, match -> the)
Map(start -> 71, end -> 73, match -> the)


A quantitative study, using data collected from 122 participants further elaborates on the relationship between the influence of leader-member exchange on employee work satisfaction and the moderating role of work values.

Academy of Strategic Management Journal, Volume 12, Number 1, 2013 A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE Leader-Member Exchange Theory Leader-member-exchange (LMX) theory is a relatively contemporary theory within leadership studies.
Map(start -> 9, end -> 10, match -> of)
Map(start -> 51, end -> 51, match -> ,)
Map(start -> 61, end -> 61, match -> ,)


Many leadership theories solely focus on the behaviors of the leader, rather than also noting the followers’ involvement.
Map(start -> 26, end -> 31, match -> solely)

Map(start -> 78, end -> 81, match -> than)
Map(start -> 95, end -> 97, match -> the)


Dansereau, Graen, and Haga (1975) originated the construct when introducing the vertical dyad linkage (VDL) theory.
Map(start -> 46, end -> 48, match -> the)
Map(start -> 77, end -> 79, match -> the)


VDL evolved into LMX theory with the emphasis on a leader’s relationship with each individual organizational member (Graen & Scandura, 1987).
Map(start -> 34, end -> 36, match -> the)


The central focus of the theory is understanding the relationship that exists between the supervisor and employee as well as the exchanges that take place over time between the two.
Map(start -> 19, end -> 20, match -> of)
Map(start -> 22, end -> 24, match -> the)
Map(start -> 50, end -> 52, match -> the)
Map(start -> 87, end -> 89, match -> the)
Map(start -> 126, end -> 128, match -> the)
Map(start -> 174, end -> 176, match -> the)


It has been suggested that these relationships form based on “personal compatibility and subordinate competence and dependability” (Yukl, 2006, p. 117).
Map(start -> 4, end -> 6, match -> has)
Map(start -> 143, end -> 143, match -> ,)


Dienesch and Linden (1986) argue that each behave based on the amount of resources one puts forth into the relationship.
Map(start -> 60, end -> 62, match -> the)
Map(start -> 71, end -> 72, match -> of)
Map(start -> 104, end -> 106, match -> the)


“For example, the leader may offer increased job latitude or delegation to the member, and the member may offer strong commitment to work goals or high levels of effort and performance to the leader” (Bauer & Green, 1996, p. 1538).
Map(start -> 15, end -> 17, match -> the)
Map(start -> 76, end -> 78, match -> the)
Map(start -> 92, end -> 94, match -> the)

Map(start -> 189, end -> 191, match -> the)
Map(start -> 221, end -> 221, match -> ,)


However, a leader has only a limited amount of resources to dispense upon individual followers.
Map(start -> 19, end -> 21, match -> has)
Map(start -> 23, end -> 26, match -> only)
Map(start -> 45, end -> 46, match -> of)


Therefore, Green, Anderson, and Shivers (1996) note the disparity between what is considered high-level exchanges and lower-level exchanges.
Map(start -> 53, end -> 55, match -> the)


Whereas, those that evolve based on obligation of organizational employment will experience a lower quality relationship (Liden, Sparrowe & Wayne, 1997).
Map(start -> 48, end -> 49, match -> of)


Since the origination of LMX theory, a growing body of research has been conducted to determine the outcomes of LMX theory.
Map(start -> 7, end -> 9, match -> the)

Many of the studies confirm that a follower’s relationship with the leader is crucial to one’s work experience (Graen & Cashman, 1975; Graen & Uhl-Bien, 1995).
Map(start -> 6, end -> 7, match -> of)
Map(start -> 9, end -> 11, match -> the)
Map(start -> 65, end -> 67, match -> the)


One of the noteworthy outcomes supported in the literature is that leadermember exchange is related to subordinate satisfaction (Graen, Novak & Sommerkamp, 1982; Graen, Orris & Johnson, 1973l; Scandura & Graen, 1984).
Map(start -> 5, end -> 6, match -> of)
Map(start -> 8, end -> 10, match -> the)
Map(start -> 45, end -> 47, match -> the)


Liden and Maslyn’s studies (1998) also have found a significant correlation between LMX and job satisfaction.
Map(start -> 40, end -> 43, match -> have)


In addition, few studies exist surrounding the influence that LMX has on the different factors of job satisfaction, intrinsic and extrinsic.
Map(start -> 44, end -> 46, match -> the)
Map(start -> 67, end -> 69, match -> has)
Map(start -> 74, end -> 76, match -> the)
Map(start -> 96, end -> 97, match -> of)


Springer (2006) explored the relationship of overall LMX and its varying influence on either extrinsic or intrinsic job satisfaction.
Map(start -> 26, end -> 28, match -> the)
Map(start -> 43, end -> 44, match -> of)


Two questions under consideration are does LMX dimensions positively correlate with job satisfaction and do these factors of LMX differ on their impact between extrinsic and intrinsic motivators of job satisfaction.

(2001) describes job satisfaction as the gratifying state one experiences while on the job.
Map(start -> 37, end -> 39, match -> the)
Map(start -> 83, end -> 85, match -> the)


Work satisfaction is known to not only impact one’s work life, but also one’s personal life as well (Judge & Watanable, 1993).
Map(start -> 22, end -> 26, match -> known)

Map(start -> 35, end -> 38, match -> only)


“Job satisfaction has larger effects on life satisfaction, suggesting that job satisfaction is an essential component of an employee’s life” (Fields, 2002, p. 2).
Map(start -> 19, end -> 21, match -> has)
Map(start -> 119, end -> 120, match -> of)
Map(start -> 155, end -> 155, match -> ,)

Also noted is that employees who are more satisfied in their role are more likely to outperform those who are not (Ostroff, 1992).
Map(start -> 110, end -> 112, match -> not)


Therefore, it is important to understand the impact of employee satisfaction within the workplace, and the role leader-member-exchange plays in influencing it.
Map(start -> 12, end -> 40, match -> it is important to understand)

Map(start -> 85, end -> 87, match -> the)
Map(start -> 104, end -> 106, match -> the)

Employee work satisfaction stems from a variety of factors, such as the comparison of anticipated outcomes with definite consequences (Cranny, Smith, & Stone, 1992), internal and external job components (Howard & Frank, 1996), job performance (George & Jones, 1997), as well as values (Kinicki & Kreitner, 2007).

Map(start -> 265, end -> 265, match -> ,)


Also worth nothing is that Zeitz (1990) found an employee’s perception of management helped explain job satisfaction.
Map(start -> 72, end -> 73, match -> of)


While numerous studies in the literature support the relationship between LMX and job satisfaction, few have explored the difference in follower experience of LMX between intrinsic and extrinsic job satisfaction.
Map(start -> 27, end -> 29, match -> the)
Map(start -> 50, end -> 52, match -> the)
Map(start -> 105, end -> 108, match -> have)
Map(start -> 119, end -> 121, match -> the)
Map(start -> 157, end -> 158, match -> of)


Questions remain such as does a followers perception of LMX have greater influence on the employee’s extrinsic or intrinsic job satisfaction?
Map(start -> 54, end -> 55, match -> of)
Map(start -> 61, end -> 64, match -> have)
Map(start -> 87, end -> 89, match -> the)


Therefore, the proposed model suggests that leader-member exchange will be positively relate to both intrinsic and extrinsic job satisfaction, but have a greater influence on an employee’s extrinsic job satisfaction.
Map(start -> 12, end -> 14, match -> the)
Map(start -> 148, end -> 151, match -> have)


The rationale behind the greater influence on extrinsic job satisfaction is the manager’s ability to influence those facets of an employee’s job.

The model also proposes the following control variables should also be considered based on their potential influence on job satisfaction: a) an employee’s compensation, b) gender, c) age, and d) education level, as these have found to have an influence on employee work satisfaction as well (Fields, 2002).

H1a: Followers’ experience with leader-member exchange are positively related to overall employee work satisfaction H1b: Followers’ experience with leader-member exchange is more positively related to extrinsic job satisfaction than intrinsic job satisfaction Individual Work Values While the literature is full of studies examining leader-member exchange and its outcomes, there are few if not any that examine the moderating influence of an employee’s individual work values.

Work values are those basic values expressed in a work setting (Ros et al., 1999).
Map(start -> 75, end -> 75, match -> ,)


These work values represent what an employee is seeking for in their general work experience.
Map(start -> 57, end -> 59, match -> for)


Therefore, work values will generally influence the way the employee views the role of his or her manager.
Map(start -> 49, end -> 51, match -> the)
Map(start -> 57, end -> 59, match -> the)
Map(start -> 76, end -> 78, match -> the)
Map(start -> 85, end -> 86, match -> of)


Harding, Phillips, and Fogarty’s (1986) work confirm the role values play in the personal development of employees and the way it affects the employee’s outlook.

Map(start -> 139, end -> 141, match -> the)


If on the other hand an employee values power over the relationship with one’s supervisor, the quality of the exchange with one’s manager will lessen in its ability to influence the employee’s satisfaction.

The proposed model will focus on Schwartz’s (1994) theory of basic human values, in which the researcher identifies ten specific motivational values, which are universally recognized.
Map(start -> 59, end -> 60, match -> of)
Map(start -> 91, end -> 93, match -> the)


Table 2 summarizes the various motivational values, which fall under each category.
Map(start -> 20, end -> 22, match -> the)


For this, particular study, self-enhancement and self-transcendence values are chosen for measurement by using an abbreviated version of Schwartz (1994) Work Values Survey.
Map(start -> 5, end -> 8, match -> this)
Map(start -> 87, end -> 89, match -> for)
Map(start -> 135, end -> 136, match -> of)


The literature supports that two core components, for example self-transcendence and conservation, “share a single motivational goal—subordination on self in favor of socially imposed expectations” (Ros et al., 1999, p. 52).
Map(start -> 51, end -> 53, match -> for)

Map(start -> 210, end -> 210, match -> ,)
Map(start -> 216, end -> 216, match -> ,)


Therefore, the focus on self-enhancement and selftranscendence will simplify the study while ensuring that all motivational goals are being measured.

On the other end of the spectrum of values is self-transcendence, which emphasizes tolerance and viewing all as equals, and therefore expressing concern for the general welfare (Elenkov, Naoumova, Lowery, Chornovil, Sarov, & Andov, 2004).

To measure the dimensions of leader-member exchange, the LMX-MDM instrument originated by Liden and Maslyn (1998) is used.
Map(start -> 12, end -> 14, match -> the)

While the instrument can measure four identified dimensions within the LMX construct (professional respect, contribution, loyalty, and affect), Graen and Uhl-Bien (1995) note that, “LMX construct has multiple dimensions, but these dimensions are so highly correlated that they can be tapped into with the single measure of LMX” (p. 237).

Therefore, due to the high level of inter-correlations among the dimensions within the instrument, the overall construct of LMX, which measures the quality of one’s exchange with a direct supervisor, will be used throughout the analysis and results, rather than analyzing four individual highly correlated dimensions.

Two multiple hierarchical moderated regression analyses were completed to test the main effect and the interaction hypotheses (see Table 4 & 5).
Map(start -> 80, end -> 82, match -> the)
Map(start -> 100, end -> 102, match -> the)

To test each of the moderation effects, the control variables were entered into the first block (age, gender, income, and education), followed by the main effects of overall LMX and values, and the interaction in the last box.

The impact of the interaction is visually shown in Figure 2. As hypothesized, those employees who perceived a high-level exchange with their supervisor were more likely to be extrinsically satisfied in their employment when espoused with selftranscendence values.

DISCUSSION This study adds to the theoretical framework in at least two specific regards.
Map(start -> 31, end -> 33, match -> the)


The first is the finding that while LMX has a positive impact on overall job satisfaction, there is a greater significant influence on extrinsic facets of job satisfaction compared to intrinsic.
Map(start -> 14, end -> 16, match -> the)
Map(start -> 41, end -> 43, match -> has)
Map(start -> 153, end -> 154, match -> of)


The positive influence of LMX on overall job satisfaction is consistent with existing LMX Theory, which focuses on the level of exchange between employee and supervisor, (Graen, 1995) leading to a significant impact on employee work satisfaction.
Map(start -> 24, end -> 25, match -> of)
Map(start -> 116, end -> 118, match -> the)
Map(start -> 126, end -> 127, match -> of)


Specifically, LMX dimensions, which note a high-quality exchange, are directly positively associated with both extrinsic as well as intrinsic job satisfaction factors, consistent with the findings in previous studies (eg.
Map(start -> 185, end -> 187, match -> the)


As Stringer (2006) notes, “When employees have a high quality relationship with their supervisor they get to enjoy the benefits of favors such as mutual trust, support from their supervisor, effective communication, consideration, and esteem, and consequently, they more likely will be satisfied with their job, accomplish more, and help the organization prosper” (p. 136).
Map(start -> 43, end -> 46, match -> have)
Map(start -> 116, end -> 118, match -> the)
Map(start -> 129, end -> 130, match -> of)
Map(start -> 339, end -> 341, match -> the)


While many historical studies have found LMX to positively influence overall job satisfaction, few have focused on determining what specific facets of job satisfaction are most impacted.
Map(start -> 31, end -> 34, match -> have)
Map(start -> 100, end -> 103, match -> have)
Map(start -> 149, end -> 150, match -> of)


The findings of the study are consistent with Herzberg’s (1959) theory of job satisfaction, which states that extrinsic needs are influenced by supervision and relationships, whereas intrinsic needs are fulfilled by advancement, achievement and increased responsibility.
Map(start -> 14, end -> 15, match -> of)
Map(start -> 17, end -> 19, match -> the)
Map(start -> 72, end -> 73, match -> of)


It appears that as the level of exchange between supervisor and employee increases, the likelihood of extrinsic needs being fulfilled also increases.
Map(start -> 20, end -> 22, match -> the)
Map(start -> 30, end -> 31, match -> of)
Map(start -> 85, end -> 87, match -> the)
Map(start -> 100, end -> 101, match -> of)


Therefore, the higher the exchange the greater opportunities the manager has in removing extrinsic barriers to an employee’s satisfaction.
Map(start -> 12, end -> 14, match -> the)
Map(start -> 23, end -> 25, match -> the)
Map(start -> 36, end -> 38, match -> the)
Map(start -> 62, end -> 64, match -> the)
Map(start -> 74, end -> 76, match -> has)


Noted within the literature is the effect, not only a high quality exchange has, but also a low quality relationship on extrinsic job satisfaction.
Map(start -> 14, end -> 16, match -> the)
Map(start -> 32, end -> 34, match -> the)
Map(start -> 44, end -> 46, match -> not)
Map(start -> 48, end -> 51, match -> only)
Map(start -> 77, end -> 79, match -> has)


Memmi (1974) and Noddings (1984) found that employees with low quality relationships with their supervisor felt nonchalantly supported by the organization.
Map(start -> 139, end -> 141, match -> the)


Khan (1998) notes that when this occurs an employee’s trust in the supervisor and organization decreases, and therefore only shares information relevant to complete the job.

Map(start -> 64, end -> 66, match -> the)
Map(start -> 121, end -> 124, match -> only)
Map(start -> 166, end -> 168, match -> the)


Problems arise such as burnout, alienation, and ultimately employees leaving the organization.
Map(start -> 78, end -> 80, match -> the)


Therefore, it is of the upmost importance that managers continue to develop the attributes of affect, loyalty, contribution and professional respect, which in return will likely result in high employee extrinsic job satisfaction.

Results from the study indicate that the relationship between LMX and extrinsic job satisfaction is more strongly related when an employee values relationships and the welfare of the organization, which is consistent with Schwartz’s (1996) work values theory on selftranscendence values.
Map(start -> 14, end -> 16, match -> the)

Map(start -> 177, end -> 178, match -> of)
Map(start -> 180, end -> 182, match -> the)


Furthermore, to the researcher’s knowledge, there are no existing studies, which examine the link of one’s individual work values on the interpretation of LMX and job satisfaction.
Map(start -> 17, end -> 19, match -> the)
Map(start -> 45, end -> 53, match -> there are)

Map(start -> 153, end -> 154, match -> of)


The supervisor is seen as an extension of the organization, and when the level of relationship is low, the employee’s relationship with the organization is more likely to be disengaged (Memmi, 1974).
Map(start -> 40, end -> 41, match -> of)
Map(start -> 43, end -> 45, match -> the)

Map(start -> 80, end -> 81, match -> of)
Map(start -> 104, end -> 106, match -> the)
Map(start -> 137, end -> 139, match -> the)


Therefore, it is important for managers to realize that they represent the organization for their employees, and their level of support and values is concurrent with how their employees view the entire organization.
Map(start -> 28, end -> 30, match -> for)
Map(start -> 72, end -> 74, match -> the)

Map(start -> 126, end -> 127, match -> of)
Map(start -> 192, end -> 194, match -> the)


While it was found that self-transcendence values moderate the influence of LMX on extrinsic job satisfaction, it is worthy to note that self-transcendence values is not directly associated with LMX (r = 0.05).
Map(start -> 10, end -> 12, match -> was)
Map(start -> 60, end -> 62, match -> the)
Map(start -> 74, end -> 75, match -> of)
Map(start -> 167, end -> 169, match -> not)


This finding suggests that LMX’s direct impact on job satisfaction is largely through its dimensions (affect, contribution, loyalty and professional respect) rather than the leader’s concern for the general welfare of the organization.
Map(start -> 111, end -> 122, match -> contribution)

This purpose of this study was to understand and clarify the moderating role of individual work values on the relationship between leader-member exchange and work satisfaction within the American workforce.

Map(start -> 107, end -> 109, match -> the)

The question was posed, what do values have to do with it?
Map(start -> 14, end -> 16, match -> was)
Map(start -> 40, end -> 43, match -> have)


In summary, values have much to do with the relationship between leadership and employee job satisfaction, specifically as it relates to LMX and extrinsic job factors.
Map(start -> 20, end -> 23, match -> have)
Map(start -> 41, end -> 43, match -> the)


The findings reveal two important contributions to the literature including LMX’s greater influence on extrinsic job satisfaction and the moderating role of self-transcendence values.
Map(start -> 35, end -> 47, match -> contributions)
Map(start -> 52, end -> 54, match -> the)
Map(start -> 135, end -> 137, match -> the)
Map(start -> 155, end -> 156, match -> of)


This implies that the role of the supervisor in representing the organization is amplified for those employees who possess self-transcendence values.
Map(start -> 19, end -> 21, match -> the)

Map(start -> 31, end -> 33, match -> the)
Map(start -> 62, end -> 64, match -> the)
Map(start -> 92, end -> 94, match -> for)


Therefore, supervisors must be cognizant of their level of exchange with employees and its ultimate impact on both the employee and organization.

LIMITATIONS It is important to understand the results with the perspective of potential limitations of the study.

Map(start -> 89, end -> 112, match -> limitations of the study)


There are at least three limitations identified.
Map(start -> 26, end -> 36, match -> limitations)


The first limitation deals with the nature of a cross-sectional study design, which does not allow for claims regarding the causality of LMX, work values and job satisfaction.
Map(start -> 11, end -> 20, match -> limitation)
Map(start -> 33, end -> 35, match -> the)
Map(start -> 44, end -> 45, match -> of)
Map(start -> 90, end -> 92, match -> not)
Map(start -> 100, end -> 102, match -> for)
Map(start -> 121, end -> 123, match -> the)
Map(start -> 135, end -> 136, match -> of)


Therefore, there is a need for a well-designed longitudinal study, which could further explain the complexity of the relationships examined and potentially make causal inferences.
Map(start -> 12, end -> 30, match -> there is a need for)
Map(start -> 28, end -> 30, match -> for)
Map(start -> 12, end -> 32, match -> there is a need for a)
Map(start -> 12, end -> 59, match -> there is a need for a well-designed longitudinal)

Map(start -> 96, end -> 98, match -> the)
Map(start -> 111, end -> 112, match -> of)
Map(start -> 114, end -> 116, match -> the)


The second limitation is the fact that the questionnaire design can also lead to the halo effect and common method variances.
Map(start -> 5, end -> 21, match -> second limitation)
Map(start -> 12, end -> 21, match -> limitation)
Map(start -> 5, end -> 24, match -> second limitation is)
Map(start -> 26, end -> 28, match -> the)
Map(start -> 40, end -> 42, match -> the)
Map(start -> 82, end -> 84, match -> the)


The researcher cannot exclude to mention that the evaluation of one’s supervisor will cause the respondent to evaluate all aspects in a similar manner.
Map(start -> 47, end -> 49, match -> the)
Map(start -> 62, end -> 63, match -> of)
Map(start -> 93, end -> 95, match -> the)


Podsakoff et al (2009) suggest procedural and statistical measures to be taken to Academy of Strategic Management Journal, Volume 12, Number 1, 2013 protect against common method variance, such as ordering the questions within the survey in a diverse manner, which the researcher has done.
Map(start -> 91, end -> 92, match -> of)
Map(start -> 133, end -> 133, match -> ,)

Map(start -> 228, end -> 230, match -> the)
Map(start -> 266, end -> 268, match -> the)
Map(start -> 281, end -> 283, match -> has)


The third limitation of the study results from the data collection method chosen, which was a convenience sample.
Map(start -> 11, end -> 20, match -> limitation)
Map(start -> 11, end -> 23, match -> limitation of)
Map(start -> 22, end -> 23, match -> of)

Map(start -> 48, end -> 50, match -> the)
Map(start -> 89, end -> 91, match -> was)


Due to the time and resource constraints of the researcher, in order to collect as many sample cases as possible, the snowball method was encouraged to attract more participants.
Map(start -> 8, end -> 10, match -> the)
Map(start -> 42, end -> 43, match -> of)
Map(start -> 45, end -> 47, match -> the)
Map(start -> 115, end -> 117, match -> the)
Map(start -> 135, end -> 137, match -> was)


Therefore, the results of the study may be limited in their generalizability.
Map(start -> 12, end -> 14, match -> the)
Map(start -> 24, end -> 25, match -> of)
Map(start -> 27, end -> 29, match -> the)
Map(start -> 16, end -> 76, match -> results of the study may be limited in their generalizability)


Regarding the sample, it is also important to note that the sample tends to skew towards higher income (>40% of the participants make $90,000+) and well-educated individuals (>50% of the participants hold a bachelors degree or higher).
Map(start -> 11, end -> 13, match -> the)
Map(start -> 57, end -> 59, match -> the)
Map(start -> 110, end -> 111, match -> of)
Map(start -> 113, end -> 115, match -> the)
Map(start -> 138, end -> 138, match -> ,)
Map(start -> 181, end -> 182, match -> of)
Map(start -> 184, end -> 186, match -> the)


Therefore, it is strongly encouraged for future research to measure the moderating influence of values against a larger and more diverse sample size to allow for greater generalizability.

CONCLUSIONS This is one of the first studies to examine the moderating effect of an employee’s individual work values on the relationship between the perception of LMX and job satisfaction.
Map(start -> 25, end -> 26, match -> of)
Map(start -> 28, end -> 30, match -> the)

Map(start -> 147, end -> 149, match -> the)
Map(start -> 162, end -> 163, match -> of)


The findings reveal that employees extend their perception of the organization onto their direct leader, and therefore those whom hold self-transcendence values, will look for the supervisor for greater exchanges and support as they see them as an extension of the values of the organization.

The purpose of the study was to determine if values moderate LMX and job satisfaction, and while the results support that self-transcendence values moderate the relationship of LMX and extrinsic job satisfaction, there is an appeal for the study to be completed in a larger and more diverse sample to allow for greater generalizability of the conclusions drawn.
